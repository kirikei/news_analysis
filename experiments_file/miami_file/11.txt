Dwyane Wade picked to stay at Miami Heat
Dwyane Wade seems set to stay on with the Miami Heat as the face of the franchise after issuing a cryptic social media message as the NBA team rebuilds after losing free agent LeBron James last week.
''Home Is Where The Heart Is... My Home,My City,My House..HeatLifer,'' Wade posted on Instagram.
Multiple media outlets quickly confirmed through sources that he had agreed to sign with Miami although there was not yet official confirmation.
The news was not unexpected as Miami's front office tried to reconstruct a team that made four successive trips to the NBA Finals and won two titles before James' decision to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers following four seasons with the Heat.
Wade was part of the so-called 'Big Three' with James and forward Chris Bosh, who also has re-signed a massive deal to stay in Miami.
The Heat have also added free agent small forward Luol Deng as part of their rebuilding.
Wade, 32, has played his entire career in Miami since being drafted in 2003, winning three NBA titles and averaging more than 24 points per game during the regular season.
But he was hampered by a knee issue during the 2013-14 season, missing 28 games in a move designed to keep him healthy for the playoffs.
The Heat won the Eastern Conference title before falling decisively in five games to the San Antonio Spurs in the championship series.
Wade had invoked an early termination option after four years of a six-year deal worth US$108 million (NZ$123m), opting for free agency to free up money for the team as it sought to improve the roster and keep James.
