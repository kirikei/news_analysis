Jerry Sandusky investigators showed 'inexcusable lack of urgency' in case against ex-Penn State coach: report - NY Daily News
PAT LITTLE/REUTERS Prosecutors and police took up to three years to get the ball rolling in the sex-abuse investigation of Jerry Sandusky (center), a new report finds.
A shoddy investigation enabled ex-Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky to stay on the loose to molest children, says a report released Monday.
But the 339-page report by the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office found no evidence politics played a role in stalling the 32-month investigation of the pervert coach.
"This was a full and fair review. The facts show an inexcusable lack of urgency in charging and stopping a serial sexual predator," said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane.
Citing the report, Kane blamed the delay in getting Sandusky off the street on a lousy investigation full of "inexplicable delays."
Problems the report cited included:
- Delays in getting documents from Penn State and Sandusky's charity, The Second Mile, which would have revealed a 1998 police report accusing Sandusky of child molestation.
- A bad decision not to search Sandusky's home until two years after the state Attorney General's Office received the case.
The facts show an inexcusable lack of urgency in charging and stopping a serial sexual predator.
- A lead prosecutor's recommendation to charge Sandusky in early 2010 was ignored for five months and then denied by superiors who demanded more than one victim to justify the prosecution of an iconic coach.
"The report documents that more investigative work took place in just one month in 2011 than in all of either 2009 or 2010," Kane noted.
While running for attorney general in 2012, Kane implied her predecessor, now Gov. Tom Corbett, may have delayed the investigation for political reasons.
Corbett -- a Republican who in 2011 authorized a $3 million state grant to The Second Mile charity -- denied he interfered in the Sandusky case.
Still, Kane, a Democrat, ordered the review once she took office.
"We found no direct evidence that electoral politics influenced any important decision made in the investigation," said Geoffrey Moulton, a former federal prosecutor who led the probe.

"In fact, we found nothing ... to indicate (former) Attorney General Corbett made any decisions at all in the investigation," Moulton said.
Corbett issued a statement Monday, saying "this investigation was never about politics."
"The Sandusky investigation was conducted with a single purpose: to ensure justice for the victims and families by taking a child predator off the streets. Nothing more. Nothing less," Corbett said in the statement.
Sandusky, who was legendary Penn State head coach Joe Paterno's defensive mastermind, was convicted in June 2012 of molesting 10 boys over a 15-year span.
The 70-year-old Sandusky was sentenced to up to 60 years in prison.

Inquiry Finds No Political Pacing of Sandusky Case

HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania may have taken longer than he should have to investigate claims of sexual abuse by the former Penn State football assistant Jerry Sandusky, but there was no evidence that he tried to slow the case for political purposes as he ran for the state's highest office, according to a report released Monday.
The report, commissioned by the state's current attorney general, delved into how Corbett -- a Republican who was the attorney general when the Sandusky allegations arose in 2008 and reached the attorney general's office in 2009 -- handled the case.
The current attorney general, Kathleen Kane, a Democrat, commissioned the report after suggesting publicly that Corbett might have been motivated by electoral politics as well as campaign donations from board members of the Second Mile, a charity for disadvantaged youth that Sandusky founded and was found to have used to prey on boys. Corbett is now seeking re-election.
But on Monday, the results of the investigation by H. Geoffrey Moulton Jr., a former federal prosecutor whom Kane appointed, essentially cleared Corbett of playing politics, concluding that there was "no direct evidence that electoral politics influenced any important decision made in the Sandusky investigation."
In a statement, Corbett said: "The Sandusky investigation was conducted with a single purpose: to ensure justice for the victims and families by taking a child predator off the streets. Nothing more. Nothing less. As I have said many times, this investigation was conducted appropriately and timely."
In 2012, Sandusky, 70, was convicted of sexually assaulting 10 boys and was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. Penn State has reached civil settlements with 26 victims.
Still, as they announced the findings in a news conference Monday, Kane and Moulton second-guessed decisions that were made during the case, including how Corbett prosecuted it through a grand jury rather than quickly pressing charges.
"The facts show an inexcusable lack of urgency in charging and stopping a serial sexual predator," Kane said in a statement.
During the news conference, Kane contended that Sandusky had continued to sexually assault two boys into the fall of 2009, months after he knew an official investigation into child-abuse allegations was underway and after Corbett's office assumed jurisdiction over the case. Had the prosecutors handled the investigation differently, Kane said, this might have been avoided.
The boys apparently were ones Sandusky had abused previously. Investigators learned of this more recent abuse in the fall of 2011, Kane said.
"If there had been a search warrant issued in a very short period of time based upon Victim 1's statement," Kane said in a subsequent interview, "they would have found the additional victims, and they would have corroborated Victim 1's testimony to the point that there was enough for an arrest. And that could happen in a very short period of time -- days."
Two former prosecutors in Corbett's office -- Frank Fina and Randy Feathers -- disputed the allegation, and Fina, the chief of the criminal prosecution, called it an "outright fabrication."
"There was nobody who came forward who we found had been assaulted during this investigation," Fina said.
Moulton said in an interview Monday that those two victims were not mentioned in his report because they were beyond his scope.
Feathers and Fina called the report political, saying that the lawyers involved that that indicting Sandusky on the draft presentment -- with just a single victim and no physical evidence -- would have been unwise.
"We stand behind our investigation," said Feathers, the investigation's supervising lawyer.
At the news conference, Moulton acknowledged the validity of the prosecutors' decision but questioned whether more evidence might have been obtained by then.
The report documented that the Sandusky case was referred to Corbett's office in March 2009 and that allegations of multiple victims did not come to light until November 2010. The report found that the office chose not to arrest Sandusky in March 2010, when a prosecutor penned a draft presentment, and did not search Sandusky's home until June 2011, when a search ended up corroborating claims against him.
The review found that donations Corbett received from board members of the Second Mile had no bearing on Corbett's handling of the case.
Moulton's report, which is 166 pages and has 17 appendices, was completed after a review of tens of thousands of pages of documents and interviews with more than 50 people.
The report notes that a local district attorney's office possessed "institutional knowledge" of child abuse charges against Sandusky dating to 1998. A report commissioned by Penn State found that Coach Joe Paterno urged Penn State officials not to report a sexual assault allegation to theauthorities in 2001.
Kane said that she would have elected not to convene a grand jury and would have searched Sandusky's home under seal in March 2009.
However, she attributed these varying tactics to stylistic differences. So did the report, which described the discrepancy as "a reasonable exercise of prosecutorial discretion."
