Jerry Sandusky investigators showed 'inexcusable lack of urgency' in case against ex-Penn State coach: report - NY Daily News
PAT LITTLE/REUTERS Prosecutors and police took up to three years to get the ball rolling in the sex-abuse investigation of Jerry Sandusky (center), a new report finds.
A shoddy investigation enabled ex-Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky to stay on the loose to molest children, says a report released Monday.
But the 339-page report by the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office found no evidence politics played a role in stalling the 32-month investigation of the pervert coach.
"This was a full and fair review. The facts show an inexcusable lack of urgency in charging and stopping a serial sexual predator," said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane.
Citing the report, Kane blamed the delay in getting Sandusky off the street on a lousy investigation full of "inexplicable delays."
Problems the report cited included:
- Delays in getting documents from Penn State and Sandusky's charity, The Second Mile, which would have revealed a 1998 police report accusing Sandusky of child molestation.
- A bad decision not to search Sandusky's home until two years after the state Attorney General's Office received the case.
The facts show an inexcusable lack of urgency in charging and stopping a serial sexual predator.
- A lead prosecutor's recommendation to charge Sandusky in early 2010 was ignored for five months and then denied by superiors who demanded more than one victim to justify the prosecution of an iconic coach.
"The report documents that more investigative work took place in just one month in 2011 than in all of either 2009 or 2010," Kane noted.
While running for attorney general in 2012, Kane implied her predecessor, now Gov. Tom Corbett, may have delayed the investigation for political reasons.
Corbett -- a Republican who in 2011 authorized a $3 million state grant to The Second Mile charity -- denied he interfered in the Sandusky case.
Still, Kane, a Democrat, ordered the review once she took office.
"We found no direct evidence that electoral politics influenced any important decision made in the investigation," said Geoffrey Moulton, a former federal prosecutor who led the probe.

"In fact, we found nothing ... to indicate (former) Attorney General Corbett made any decisions at all in the investigation," Moulton said.
Corbett issued a statement Monday, saying "this investigation was never about politics."
"The Sandusky investigation was conducted with a single purpose: to ensure justice for the victims and families by taking a child predator off the streets. Nothing more. Nothing less," Corbett said in the statement.
Sandusky, who was legendary Penn State head coach Joe Paterno's defensive mastermind, was convicted in June 2012 of molesting 10 boys over a 15-year span.
The 70-year-old Sandusky was sentenced to up to 60 years in prison.

Key findings from report on Jerry Sandusky investigation | Boston Herald
Key findings from the report issued Monday by Geoff Moulton, a special deputy attorney general, into how police and prosecutors handled the child molestation investigation of Jerry Sandusky:
-- About the role of Tom Corbett as attorney general, running for governor during the investigation in 2010: Moulton found "no direct evidence that electoral politics influenced any important decision made in the Sandusky investigation."
-- "It does not appear that Attorney General Corbett took affirmative steps to slow the pace of the investigation."
-- Were there adequate resources devoted to the investigation? "While it is true that the pace and scope of the investigation increased considerably in 2011, the discovery of most victims and incidents identified in 2011 cannot be easily linked to the infusion of additional resources."
-- Investigative steps taken "relatively late in the game" were "contacting The Second Mile for lists of participants, contacting Centre County (Children and Youth Services) to ask about prior allegations, using Sandusky's autobiography to identify potential victims, and searching Sandusky's home."
-- The use of the grand jury to investigate does not appear to have slowed the investigation.
-- A draft grand jury report was circulated in early 2010, and the prosecutor who wrote it repeatedly asked her higher-ups about it until that August, when she was told the case would not go forward based on current evidence and was directed to find additional victims.
-- The case picked up steam after November 2011, when a tip to the Centre County district attorney directed investigators to Mike McQueary, then an assistant coach for Penn State's football team.
