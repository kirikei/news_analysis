Fans of the popular series will be able to download and watch season four from Amazon Instant Video, blinkbox, Google Play, Wuaki.tv and Xbox Video from Tuesday 17 June.
The series, which has broken records to become the most-pirated TV show in the world, will be available to download legally as individual episodes or the entire series, giving fans a chance to watch the show again before it is released as a boxset.
Game of Thrones was named the most pirated TV show of 2013, with an estimated 5.9 million episodes downloaded via BitTorrent.
The second episode of the latest series broke another record to become the most-shared TV episode at one time, with over 190,000 people found to be simultaneously sharing it online.
In the UK, series four aired the day after its initial broadcast on HBO in the US, leading to a police crackdown on piracy and illegal download websites.
Based on the book series by George RR Martin, Game of Thrones season four has become HBO's most successful series to date, beating The Sopranos to become the channel's most-watched drama.
The average Game of Thrones audience increased from 18 million to 18.4 million earlier this month to overtake The Sopranos' 18.2 million ratings record.
