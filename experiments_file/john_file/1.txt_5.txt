Iran must be 'more realistic' in nuclear talks: Britain's Hague | Reuters

VIENNA (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday it was crucial for Iran "to be more realistic about what is necessary" to reach a nuclear deal with six major powers that would end sanctions against Tehran in exchange for curbs on its atomic work.
Hague was speaking to reporters after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Together with their French and German counterparts, they are in Vienna to help break a deadlock in the nuclear negotiations with Iran, a week before a deadline to reach an agreement.

This will be the hardest divide to bridge, not least because Khamenei has publicly made it a matter of national pride. One possibility is a phased solution in which there is an agreed low ceiling for enrichment for a few years, and later expansion is dependent on proven need and high marks for transparency from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Another is for Russia to provide several years' fuel for Bushehr in advance, to overcome any doubt over reliability of supply, and the stockpile would be stored in Iran under IAEA safeguards.
Arak
For more than 12 years, Iran has been building a heavy water reactor in Arak, which is now close to completion. Officially it is for the production of isotopes for various industrial, agricultural, medical and other scientific uses. Western sceptics point out the planned reactor is more powerful than would be needed for such uses. They believe it is for the production of plutonium, another route to make a bomb, which is created as part of the spent fuel.
Iran refuses to scrap the project, saying it has invested a lot of time and money in it, building a heavy water production plant nearby. But this could be a relatively easy issue to fix. A change in design would mean it would produce less than 1kg of plutonium a year, rather than the 9kg expected from the existing blueprint, which would be nearly enough for two warheads. Iran would undertake not to build a reprocessing facility for extracting the plutonium, which would be exported as part of the spent fuel. Iran officials have said they are already working in that direction.
Past weaponisation work
The question of whether Iran had a large-scale programme to develop technologies for making a warhead, at least until 2003 as most Western intelligence agencies believe, has not been resolved. For many years, IAEA inspectors have been presenting a shopping list of requests to see documents, interview scientists, and visit suspects sites, but have made little progress.
The matter is being dealt with outside the main talks, in a series of meetings and visits between IAEA and Iranian officials, but the two issues are inevitably linked. It would be hard to imagine a comprehensive deal on Iran's programme without the questions about the past development work being settled, as it concerns the fundamental issue of whether the international community trusts Iran to be transparent about its nuclear activities.
The big short-term problem is how to dovetail the two negotiating tracks: the six powers and the IAEA, so the latter does not become an obstacle to the former.
Oversight
Long-term increased scrutiny by IAEA inspectors would have to be part of any nuclear deal. At a minimum, this would involve a regime of enhanced inspections which the IAEA calls the "additional protocol". This would involve access by inspection teams to all parts of the nuclear cycle, from uranium mining onwards, and would allow them to take environmental samples anywhere they deem fit. Most Western diplomats say they will demand a programme of even more intrusive inspections, "additional protocol plus". The Iranians may balk at this, as their touchstone is to be treated like any other state. However, it is possible to envisage an intense period of inspections and monitoring that would diminish over the time, as mutual confidence between the parties grows.
Sanctions
Sanctions relief is the main bargaining chip the six powers have in their hands at the negotiating table, and it is one of the thorniest issues, because having placed sanctions on Iran, Western governments are going to find it hard to take them off. Over the years, the US and EU have gone beyond measures agreed at the UN, and built up a tangle of interlocking and overlapping punitive restrictions on doing business with Iran. The most serious constraint on sanctions relief is that the Obama administration does not have it in its gift to permanently lift sanctions. Only Congress can do that, and Republican legislators are in no mood to cooperate. The US president can grant temporary waivers but that does not impress the Iranians, who are wary of being tricked. The EU could lift its oil embargo and financial restrictions, but only if there is consensus.
Buying Iranian oil and gas would go a long way towards rescuing the country's economy, as would allowing insurance of Iranian shipping, and unfreezing an estimated $100 billion in Iranian oil revenues held abroad. The problem of US sanctions and Congress could be sidestepped because some of the American sanctions have a sunset clause that means they lapse next year anyway.
