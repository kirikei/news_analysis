Government bonds rallied around the world, with a gauge of the debt climbing to a 14-month high, as the shooting down of a Malaysia Airlines plane in Ukraine drove demand for the safest assets.
An index of sovereign debt rose to the highest level since May 2013 yesterday, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. The securities have returned 4.3 percent this year, recouping a loss from 2013. The aircraft was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Demand for safer assets was also boosted as Israel sent soldiers and tanks into Gaza.
"There's geopolitical risk in Ukraine and the Middle East," said Kim Youngsung, the head of overseas investment in Seoul at South Korea's Government Employees Pension Service. "People think the stock market won't be a safe place to invest. They turned to bonds." The agency invests the equivalent of $3.9 billion.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield was little changed at 2.46 percent at 11:21 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.5 percent note due in May 2024 was 100 10/32. The yield dropped as much as nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, yesterday to 2.44 percent, the lowest since May 29.
Treasury 10-year futures contracts rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 125 17/32.
Australia's 10-year yield slid by as much as nine basis points to 3.32 percent, and Japan's 10-year yield fell as far as 0.51 percent. Both figures are the lowest in more than a year.
Ukraine Crisis
The Boeing Co. 777 crashed en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam in the main battleground of Ukraine's civil war, threatening to escalate tensions in Europe's worst geopolitical crisis since the end of the Cold War.
In the Middle East, Israel sent forces into Gaza in a ground offensive aimed at stopping the barrage of missiles fired by Hamas and other Palestinian militants following the collapse of a cease-fire agreement.
The difference between U.S. five- and 30-year yields shrank to the narrowest since 2009 after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers this week that monetary stimulus is still needed, while increases in interest rates may occur sooner if the economy accelerates.
The spread shrank to 163 basis points yesterday, the least since February 2009.
