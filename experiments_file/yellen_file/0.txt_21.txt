Dollar rises broadly

RECORDER REPORT
The dollar rose broadly on Wednesday amid market speculation Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is tilting toward tightening monetary policies that have kept US interest rates at record lows. "We are seeing the dollar strong against the euro, against sterling, against the yen a little bit," said Thierry Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group Limited in New York.
Disappointing economic reports in Europe and comments on Tuesday and Wednesday by Yellen before Congress suggesting US rate hikes may come sooner than expected were driving dollar purchases, currency strategists said. "It seems to me that there are a few more hawkish hints than we have seen lately," Wizman said. "I don't think we will get more hawkish hints from the Fed until September. But the trend until then, and through that period, is strongly US dollar."
The dollar index, which measures the dollar's performance against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.2 percent to 80.565 after touching its highest level in a month. "She cracked the door open to potentially earlier US rate rises, and that has really caught the market's attention," said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
Treasury yields, seen as central to the dollar's appeal in currency markets, were initially higher on Wednesday but later slipped, with the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note up 3/32 in price to yield 2.537 percent after touching a high of 2.57 percent. Sterling fell against the dollar to $1.7135, off a nearly six-year high of $1.7192 struck on Tuesday, but it was up against the euro to a near two-year peak. The euro was down 0.35 percent at $1.3523, falling to its lowest in one month, while the greenback was slightly higher against the yen at 101.71 yen after touching a one-week high of 101.79.

Gold extended an advance from a three-week low amid signs of increased demand in China and India, the world's two largest consumers. Palladium climbed to the highest level since 2001 on increased Russian sanctions.
Bullion for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.6 percent to $1,307.15 an ounce and traded at $1,306.83 at 1:39 p.m. in Singapore, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. The metal fell to $1,292.26 on July 15, the lowest level since June 19 as investors assessed prospects for higher U.S. interest rates. Palladium climbed to $879.70 an ounce, the highest since February 2001, on concern that supplies from Russia, the world's biggest producer, may be restricted.
Gold imports by India jumped 65 percent to $3.12 billion in June from $1.89 billion a year earlier, after the central bank allowed more banks and traders to buy bullion overseas, the Commerce Ministry said yesterday. In China, which surpassed India last year as the biggest consumer, volumes for the benchmark spot contract in Shanghai rose for a second day yesterday to a one-week high of 13,421 kilograms.
"The drop below $1,300 has generated some buying interest, especially from physical users," said Zhu Siquan, an analyst at GF Futures Co. in Guangzhou, China. "Gold continues to take cues from the Federal Reserve and U.S. economic data."
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said yesterday that while she's optimistic about the economy, accommodation is necessary. U.S. data today may show improvements in the housing market after a report yesterday showed industrial production climbed in June.
SPDR Holdings
Gold sank the most in more than three decades in 2013 amid expectations the Fed will reduce stimulus as the U.S. economy recovers. Prices rebounded 8.7 percent this year, in part as U.S. policy makers pledged to keep interest rates low.
Gold for August delivery added 0.6 percent to $1,307.30 an ounce on the Comex. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed exchange traded product, fell to 806.03 metric tons yesterday, the first decline in a week.
Palladium for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent and traded at $878.25. The Obama administration, acting in concert with the European Union, imposed sanctions on Russian banks, energy companies and defense firms yesterday in a bid to punish the country over Ukraine. Spot platinum increased 0.6 percent to $1,493.54 an ounce. Silver added 0.5 percent to $20.8698 an ounce.
