July 17--Apple has set its sights on building an empire among businesses after teaming up with IT goliath IBM to sell directly to large companies.
The tech colossus, which has always been focused on consumers, is moving into the corporate sphere a world dominated for two decades by Microsoft.
Under the deal IBM will sell Apple gadgets such as iPhones and iPad tablet computers to corporate clients. A 100,000-strong team of IBM staff will be dedicated to the Apple project giving the tech giant a reach into thousands of powerful corporations.
In return, IBM will build business applications and software that can work on Apple's devices, with the first of these becoming available in the autumn. The trend of firms to let employees use their own laptops and phones at work has led to the demand for professional programs that can run on Apple devices.
Apple co-founder the late Steve Jobs was adamant about not sharing with other companies. But current chief executive Tim Cook is a former IBM employee and says: 'We've come from 30 years ago being competitors to today being incredibly complementary.
'The people that will really benefit from this are the enterprise customers who can be more productive running their businesses.'
