Apple and IBM unveil mobile device deal

SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple and International Business Machines (IBM) are putting aside a rivalry started at the dawn of the personal-computing (PC) era to get more firms to embrace iPhones and iPads.
The deal unveiled on Wednesday gives Apple access to an IBM sales force that will recommend Apple's devices to customers in industries such as healthcare and banking, which have never been priorities for the consumer-focused iPhone maker. IBM gets a boost in a long-running effort to sell software and services to firms seeking to manage workers' smartphones and tablets.
"We really recognised almost simultaneously that we could be uniquely helpful to one another's strategy and that there was literally no overlap," IBM senior vice-president of global business services Bridget Van Kralingen said in an interview.
The partnership helps Apple pursue a bigger slice of the market for corporate users of wireless devices. While many businesses allow the use of iPhones and iPads for checking e-mail and other tasks, some longtime users of PCs running Microsoft's Windows software have remained reluctant to adopt its gadgets.
For Armonk, New York-based IBM, the alliance may aid the company's efforts to catch up after watching other technology companies -- including Apple -- seize upon the growing popularity of mobile devices.
"They're now strongly associated with the premium mobile platform and mobile devices," Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett said of Apple. "If you want to do anything interesting in the enterprise, you now have to check with IBM on what they're doing with Apple."
Apple, which has seen sales growth slow in recent quarters, has already recognised the potential of the corporate market, touting that its devices are used by employees at 98% of Fortune 500 companies. Deutsche Bank has almost 20,000 iPhones, while Siemens has 30,000, Apple said in April.
"This is a shot in the arm for IBM and a great validation of Apple in the enterprise space, where they already are a huge success," Aaron Levie, CEO of cloud-storage company Box, said.
IBM shares rose 2% to $192.28 in extended trading after the pact was announced. The company is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday. Apple, which reports quarterly results on July 22, climbed 1.6% to $96.80.
Apple and rival Samsung Electronics are seeking to further displace BlackBerry, which once held a strong grip on the corporate market. Shares of BlackBerry fell 4.2% to $10.83 after Apple's deal with IBM was announced.
The partnership -- announced with a press release that included a picture of Apple CEO Tim Cook and IBM CEO Virginia Rometty walking together at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California -- would be surprising to those following the companies three decades ago.
IBM and Apple were rivals during the early days of the PC. Apple's famous "1984" Super Bowl television commercial to introduce the Macintosh computer compared IBM to George Orwell's totalitarian Big Brother.
The competition eased as IBM abandoned the PC business and instead focused on software and services geared for corporate clients. Mr Cook also worked at IBM for more than a decade before joining Apple.
While the companies' agreement targets business customers, it puts IBM back in the position of selling consumer products -- something the company left behind in 2005 with the sale of its PC unit to Lenovo Group.
IBM has identified mobile as one of the company's biggest opportunities since before Ms Rometty stepped into the role of CEO two years ago. She is seeking to reshape IBM with services such as data analytics to boost revenue growth after eight straight quarters of declines.
