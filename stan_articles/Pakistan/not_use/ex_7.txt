Officials: US drone strike kills 4 in NW Pakistan - Businessweek
ISLAMABAD (AP) -- Pakistani intelligence officials say a U.S. drone strike has killed four men in a militant hideout in the northwestern tribal region near the Afghan border.
Two officials say the missiles hit a vehicle and a compound in the town of Dandey Darpakhel in North Waziristan on Wednesday. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to media.
The strike was the third in the past two weeks as U.S. missile strikes in Pakistan resumed after six months.
North Waziristan is home to a mix of local and foreign al-Qaida-linked militant groups, who also attack American and NATO troops across the border in Afghanistan.
Pakistan's military this week launched a long awaited anti-militant offensive in the region, which Washington had insisted on for years.
