BATAAN, Philippines - To the deadly winds that toppled trees, collapsed homes or tore off roofs of buildings; and the floods that turned dozens of villages into rivers, add another peril caused by Glenda for folk in historic Bataan province: snakes.
Residents returning to their inundated homes after the worst of Glenda's winds had eased discovered to their horror that snakes unhinged by the typhoon's impact on their habitat had crawled inside the humans' homes and farms.
At least 11 towns were affected by typhoon Glenda, which cut a wide swathe of destruction and dumped rains on Bataan, the last place where the typhoon hit land before exiting through the West Philippine Sea.
At least 8,000 families were pre-emptively evacuated before Glenda struck.
Bataan is one of the provinces placed under a state of calamity.
