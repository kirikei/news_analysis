MANILA, Philippines-The Manila Electric Company (Meralco) said on Friday that a five- to six-hour rotating brownout would still affect some residents in Metro Manila and nearby provinces two days after typhoon "Glenda" (international name: Rammasun) battered the country and damaged most power lines in Luzon.
"A rotating brownout that will last for about 5-6 hours occurred starting 7:50 AM due to insufficient power supply," Meralco said in a statement posted over Twitter.
It said affected area would include portions of Manila, Quezon City, Las Pinas, and provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Batangas, and Laguna.
In its latest Twitter post, Meralco listed the affected areas which would experience rotating power interruptions from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
