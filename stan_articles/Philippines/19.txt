MANILA -- Typhoon Glenda (Rammasun) is now out of the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) while a low pressure area is expected to enter the country in the next 24 hours, the state weather bureau said Thursday.
Weather forecaster Aldczar Aurelio said that as of 8 a.m., Glenda was located at 480 kilometers (km) west of Dagupan City with maximum winds of 140 kilometers per hour (kph) near the center and gustiness of up to 170 kph.
Aurelio said Glenda continues to move northwest at 30 kph and headed toward China.
He added that sea travel is still risky over the western seaboard of Luzon due to strong to gale force winds associated with the typhoon.
Meanwhile, Aurelio said a low pressure area (LPA) was spotted some 970 km east of Northern Mindanao, but is still outside the country.
Within the next 24 hours, the LPA is expected to enter PAR but will not yet directly affect the country, he said.
Based on their models, Aurelio said the LPA has high chance to develop into a tropical cyclone since it is still in the sea.
He added that once the LPA intensifies into tropical cyclone inside PAR, it will be locally named "Henry," the eight tropical cyclone to enter the country this year and the third for the month of July. (PNA)
