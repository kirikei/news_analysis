Jeter's final All-Star appearance helped boost television ratings for the game.
The game averaged more than 11.3 million viewers on Fox, up from 11 million for last year's game at the Mets' Citi Field in New York.
The rating was up 9 percent for the first full half-hour, when the retiring Yankees shortstop first stepped to the plate.
