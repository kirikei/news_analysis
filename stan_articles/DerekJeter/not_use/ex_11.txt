Viral Video of the Day: 'Re2pect' for Jeter - The Daily Beast
Tuesday night's MLB All-Star Game was the last for Derek Jeter. The New York Yankees' shortstop announced earlier this year that he would retire at the end of the current season.
As a tribute, Nike produced a farewell video called 'Re2pect,' after Jeter's number. It features a host of athletes, celebs, and public figures all tipping their caps to The Captain. Former NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani, Jay Z, Billy Crystal, and basketball legend Michael Jordan--who is sponsoring the campaign for Nike--make appearances.
To illustrate the reach of respect for Jeter, the video also features Boston Red Sox fans tipping their caps, as well as the Yanks' subway rivals, the New York Mets, all with their faces pixelated to protect them.
This tribute video may be circulating now but Jeter still has the next couple of months before he hangs up his glove for good.
