Recap: Padres 4, Mariners 1
Padres 4, Mariners 1: Everth Cabrera capped a four-run seventh inning with a two-RBI single as host San Diego earned a split of the four-game, home-and-home interleague series.
Making his third career start, rookie Jesse Hahn (2-1) struck out seven and allowed an unearned run and five hits over seven innings and Huston Street worked around two hits in the ninth to record his 20th save. Cameron Maybin went 2-for-3 with an RBI triple and scored a run as San Diego won back-to-back games for the first time this month.
Robinson Cano collected three hits and drove in the lone run for Seattle, which had won its previous eight day games. The Mariners wasted a superb effort by Erasmo Ramirez, who allowed two hits over six scoreless innings before Dominic Leone (2-1) was lit up for four runs in one-third of an inning.
Seattle broke the scoreless deadlock in the fifth as Brad Miller drew a leadoff walk and was safe at second base when Cabrera dropped a ball on an attempted force play. After James Jones struck out, Cano delivered a two-out single to right-center to plate Miller.
Leone replaced Ramirez to start the seventh and gave up back-to-back triples to Tommy Medica and Maybin, who scored the go-ahead run on Chris Denorfia's single to center. Cabrera provided a pair of insurance runs with a two-out single to center to make it 4-1.
GAME NOTEBOOK: Cano extended his road hitting streak to 20 games, the longest span in the majors. ... The Padres placed 1B Yonder Alonso on the 15-day disabled list Thursday after an MRI exam revealed tendinitis in his right wrist and promoted 1B/OF Jake Goebbert from Triple-A Iowa. ... San Diego continues its five-game homestand Friday with the first of three contests against the Los Angeles Dodgers while Seattle heads to Kansas City for a three-game set.
