Hall of Fame outfielder Tony Gwynn was remembered as the greatest player in San Diego Padres history and for his amiable personality.
Gwynn died Monday morning after battling cancer. He was 54.
Gwynn was surrounded by his family at Pomerado Hospital in Poway, California, when he died.
Gwynn spent his entire Hall of Fame career with the San Diego Padres from 1982-2001. He had 3,141 hits and a career .338 batting average (18th best all-time) in 2,440 games. He batted above .300 in 19 of his 20 major league seasons, including .394 in 1994.
A 15-time All-Star, Gwynn won eight batting titles, five Gold Glove Awards and was inducted in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.
He also played a significant role in the Padres winning National League pennants in 1984 and 1998, hitting a combined .371 in the two World Series.
Gwynn was a first-ballot Hall of Famer. He was named on 532 of 545 ballots (97.6 percent), along with Cal Ripken Jr. as the 2007 class of inductees. Gwynn also was given the 1995 Branch Rickey Award, the 1998 Lou Gehrig Memorial Award and the 1999 Roberto Clemente Award.
