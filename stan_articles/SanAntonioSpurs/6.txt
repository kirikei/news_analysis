SEE IT: San Antonio Spurs fan falls from back of moving car during championship celebration - NY Daily News
Everyone falls, but it's the true champions -- and their fans -- that get right back up.
Even when the fall is from a moving car.
After the NBA's San Antonio Spurs defeated the Miami Heat 104-87 Sunday night to win the NBA Finals, the San Antonio, Tex., area was filled with wild celebrations.
One fan in particular fell flat on his face, but luckily didn't need to be carried away.
The fan in a white T-shirt was sitting on the back of a four-door vehicle when he fell off and plopped face-first into the pavement.
But undeterred from the fall, he stumbles right back up to his feet, turns around and then chases after the car as the video ends.
The person who shot the video Robert Saldana, 33, of Carrizo Springs Tex., told the Daily News he decided to drive the hour into San Antonio to watch the game at a restaurant with friends. When the Spurs won they decided to head into the downtown to join the celebration.
Saldana posted the video on his Facebook page and was contacted by Rogelio Contreras - the man who fell. Contreras told The News he lost his balance on the car and fell - sustaining a broken ankle.
But he felt so good at the time he just kept going.
Saldana said being with everyone to celebrate that night was an amazing experience.
"I used to live downtown for 10 years and if they won that night I wanted to be there for the celebration," he said.
