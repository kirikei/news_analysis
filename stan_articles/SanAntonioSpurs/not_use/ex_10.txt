San Antonio Spurs 2014 Draft Preview
(Sports Network) - The San Antonio Spurs just won their fifth championship, so re-tooling is not a huge issue.
Except that it is.
Tim Duncan has a player option for next season. He's expected to decide between returning to defend San Antonio's title, or retirement.
Boris Diaw, Patty Mills and Matt Bonner, all key pieces in the title march, are free agents.
Therefore, the Spurs will be busy, but picking late.
At No. 30, San Antonio might go the foreign route that has netted them stars like Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Tiago Splitter. If Duncan were to walk, there's no way a No. 30 pick could replace that.
San Antonio always does its due diligence and nothing major scares the team off. Michigan's Mitch McGary, who suffered a back injury and was suspended for marijuana use, could be available.
Wichita State's Cleanthony Early, or the best available player, would be wise.
It's the Spurs. They're champions and they know what they're doing. With coach Gregg Popovich and general manager R.C. Buford, this should not change.
