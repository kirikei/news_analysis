Gregg Popovich counts his championship rings, possibly trolls LeBron James - SportsNation - ESPN
Gregg Popovich is notorious for trolling reporters during sideline segments and news conferences, but at the Spurs' victory parade Wednesday, he might have set his sights on LeBron James.
We all know the story -- at the introductory news conference for the Big Three, LeBron promised the Heat would win "not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven" championships. They've won just the two so far with him, which is a pretty good result, but nowhere near LeBron's lofty expectations. Popovich, on the other hand, made no such promises, but he decided to count his championships anyway, just in case anyone forgot:
We'll leave it up to you to decide if Popovich is simply celebrating, or if he's indulging in a little post-championship taunting.
