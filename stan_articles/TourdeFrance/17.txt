Tour de chaos so far | TODAYonline
PARIS -- After just 10 stages, the two pre-race favourites have crashed out of the Tour de France, and Vincenzo Nibali is wasting no time showing he's now the man to beat.
On Monday, the Italian narrowly dodged a spill by Alberto Contador that left the two-time Tour champion out of the race. Nibali went on to win a fog-and-rain-coated, up-and-down stage and in so doing, he recovered the yellow jersey that he had lost only a day earlier. "This was the hardest stage I've ever done in a Grand Tour, with seven climbs and so many crashes," said Nibali.
Contador's mishap has given this 101st edition of the race a dubious distinction of being the first in recent memory to lose its two top stars to crashes. Five stages earlier, reigning champion Chris Froome quit with a broken wrist and hand sustained after several falls.
The flurry of crashes means the Tour will have a first-time winner this year, after Andy Schleck, the 2010 champion, dropped out before Stage 4 following a crash-induced injury a day earlier.
According to his spokesman, Contador wasn't sure what caused his crash while speeding downhill at over 70kph. "He explained to me ... that he (hit) a stone or a hole in the road or something and he crashed," Jacinto Vidarte said. "He couldn't do anything about it."
TV images showed thick streams of blood pouring from Contador's right knee after the crash. Initial X-rays later indicated that the Spaniard had a fractured shin.
Monday saw plenty of spills everywhere: Italian Michele Scarponi fell heavily after misjudging a turn and colliding with a spectator. British rider Geraint Thomas also crashed but kept racing with blood pouring out of his left elbow.
Today's 11th stage features four moderate climbs toward the end, which means four downhill stretches, and with more rain forecast, you sense the chaos hasn't finished yet. AP
