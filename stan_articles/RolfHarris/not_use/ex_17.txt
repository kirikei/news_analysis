Tributes to the disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris could be torn down in his home state of Western Australia as police consider new allegations against him.
The 84-year-old was unanimously convicted at Southwark Crown Court yesterday of 12 sex charges involving four women, most while they were under age.
Following the verdict police said they would look at fresh allegations that were not part of his trial.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "We have received a number of new allegations and these are now being considered."
Dozens more alleged victims came forward during the trial, including several in Australia, and Scotland Yard has been in touch with their counterparts in the Australian police.
It is not yet clear whether they are pursuing any investigation in Harris's home country.
Harris faces prison when he is sentenced on Friday for the offences.
Following the news of his conviction Australian prime minister Tony Abbott told ABC radio: "I feel gutted and dismayed but it's very important that we do everything we humanly can to protect vulnerable young people. Sexual abuse is an utterly abhorrent crime.
"It's just sad and tragic that this person who was admired seems to have been a perpetrator."
The mayor of Perth in Western Australia said the council was considering tearing up a plaque to Harris inlaid in the city's St Georges Terrace.
Lisa Scaffidi told Fairfax radio: "I can't say until the council decision is made but the general feeling around the place is that we don't accept those kind of offences.
"It's a very sad issue and something we need to deal with."
