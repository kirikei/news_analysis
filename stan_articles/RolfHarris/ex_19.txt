Rolf Harris guilty: Friend Cathy Henkel says speaking to victim Tonya Lee opened her eyes to entertainer's abuse

A close friend of Rolf Harris who was called as a witness at his indecent assault trial has told 7.30 of how she became convinced the disgraced Australian entertainer had assaulted girls.
Film producer Cathy Henkel unintentionally introduced Harris to one of his victims in 1986 when she was in charge of an Australian theatre group that was touring the UK.
Ms Henkel, who befriended Harris after they met 40 years ago, says it was a big surprise for the children on the tour to have the opportunity to meet him.
It was during this meeting at a London pub that Harris indecently assaulted Tonya Lee, then 13, who said the entertainer put his hand up her skirt after having her sit on his lap.
Ms Lee testified as a witness at Harris's trial, where he was found guilty on 12 charges of indecent assault against four girls in between 1968 and 1986.
She told the court that after sitting on Harris's lap he followed her to the toilet and waited outside, only to assault her again.
"I felt very, very uncomfortable and very scared at that point ... I couldn't understand why he was trapping me there," she said.
Ms Henkel told 7.30 tonight that while Harris had "a very cuddly, flirty personality" she never thought it was inappropriate and "it didn't occur to her for a second" that he would assault children.
But she said that all changed when she spoke to Ms Lee about that night at the London pub.
"It did take me some time, but there was a moment when Tonya told me what had happened to her - I did believe her - and also another person that I know told me he'd done the same thing to them," she said.
"At this point, yes, all hope that it had somehow been a big mistake faded."
Ms Henkel said she remembered it being a "wonderful evening" and had no idea at the time that Harris had abused Ms Lee.
"It did not occur to me for one second that he had done anything inappropriate to Tonya.
"She was 13 at the time and was just not able to tell me, which I now understand. She was intimidated, she was scared, she was terrified her mother would find out.
"She was afraid no-one would believe her. I think the story is when somebody is that famous and that well known and she knew he was a friend of mine it is very very hard for a child to talk about that and confess."
Pressure from Harris's brother to deny allegations
Ms Henkel says she was contacted by Rolf's brother, Bruce, when the accusation by Ms Lee was first made.
She says she felt pressured by the entertainer's brother to say the indecent assault did not happen.
"He did badger me a little bit in the sense of asking me repeatedly 'It couldn't have happened, you must be able to say it couldn't have happened' - but I couldn't say that because the circumstances were there," she said.
"I didn't see it happen, but I couldn't say it didn't happen, so I did feel pressured about that and eventually I had to say 'Look, I'm sorry, I can't say it didn't happen."
Harris will be sentenced on Friday, and has been told to expect to face jail time. Each of his sentences carries a maximum sentence of two years.
British police have also confirmed they are looking into fresh allegations against the entertainer.
