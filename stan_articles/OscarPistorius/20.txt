Oscar Pistorius was of sound mind when he killed his model girlfriend, a panel of medical experts has concluded.
He was 'capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act' when he shot Reeva Steenkamp, prosecutor Gerrie Nel told his trial yesterday.
The trial of the South African para-lympian, 27, was halted for a month so he could be assessed at Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital in Pretoria. His evaluation was ordered after defence psychiatrist Dr Merryll Vorster testified the double amputee feels vulnerable and had an anxiety disorder that could have contributed to the killing.
Pistorius said he mistakenly shot Miss Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year after mistaking her for an intruder. The prosecution alleges he killed her deliberately after a heated row.
Meanwhile, defence lawyer Barry Roux called surgeon Gerald Versfeld, who amputated Pistorius's lower legs when he was 11 months old.
The athlete was born without fibulas, the bones that run from below the knee to the ankle.
Judge Thokozile Masipa and her two legal assessors inspected Pistorius's stumps as he sat on a bench.
He was on stumps when he killed Miss Steenkamp and his defence team has argued he was more likely to confront a perceived danger than flee because of his limited movement.
Mr Versfeld told the court Pistorius's disability made him 'vulnerable in a dangerous situation'.
The trial in Pretoria continues.
