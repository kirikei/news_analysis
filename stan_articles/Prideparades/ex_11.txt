More than 12,000 people, including Canadian politicians, actors and Olympic athletes, turned out to march in Toronto's largest ever pride parade Sunday.
The parade capped off 10 days of festivities celebrating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities. Toronto played host to WorldPride this year, marking the first time a WorldPride festival taken place in a North American city.
"The energy is always up during this event but it's just on steroids this weekend," said Steve Nardi, 51, who marched in the parade. "It's been fantastic, absolutely fantastic."
Visitors from as far away as the Netherlands, Uganda and Texas came to celebrate the event in Toronto.
"We are free here. We're able to express ourselves in a better and a more accepting environment -- something we cannot do back home," said Mojalifa Mokoele, 29, who flew in from Zimbabwe just for World Pride. "It's homely. It feels like the whole world is here."
Liberal Party of Canada leader Justin Trudeau marched in the parade with a group of Liberal supporters and Ontario's newly elected and first openly gay premier, Kathleen Wynne.
"I've seen so many people from every corner of the world, literally," Mr. Trudeau said, adding that he'd spoken with people from Australia, South Africa and Jamaica earlier in the day. "[Canada] is a place that actually gets it, that stands up for human rights around the world and welcomes people in."
At the parade some marchers dressed in elaborate costumes and headdresses with feathers, while others wore no clothes at all. One group of men dressed up as fruit.
Some bystanders wore rainbow tutus and heavy makeup, dancing while they watched floats go by, and others wore WorldPride t-shirts and held hands with their young children, dressed in matching outfits.
With temperatures reaching 29 C and feeling like high 30s Sunday, some bystanders collapsed in the heat and were treated by paramedics. Others welcomed sprays of water from parade participants armed with water guns.
Liberal Adam Vaughan, preparing for a showdown against NDP candidate Joe Cressy in the Trinity-Spadina federal byelection Monday, had his own water gun at the ready.
"Half my riding is in the parade, the other half is watching," he said. "Hanging out here is never a bad idea as an election strategy. But I'm actually here because this is about celebrating peoples' right to love."
Parade organizers said they expect this year's parade had the largest attendance ever in Toronto. They had predicted 1.2 million people would attend pride festivities this year.
"There was no place to walk... and this is the longest parade route we've ever had. It was packed [with bystanders] the entire way," said Sean Hillier, co-chair of Pride Toronto. People were lining up the watch the parade hours before it started, he said.
Some parade marchers complained that the wait time to join the parade was longer than normal, but remained positive and hid from the sun underneath their banners and signs.
Notable attendees at Sunday's parade included Ugandan LGBT activist Frank Mughisha, the Canadian Olympic team, Canadian comedian Colin Mochrie and television personality Rick Mercer.
The next WorldPride parade, celebrated every few years, will be held in 2017 in Madrid, Spain. This year marked Toronto's 34th year celebrating the pride festival.
