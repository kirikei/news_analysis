The FDA Moves To Regulate Increasingly Popular E-Cigarettes

The Food and Drug Administration says it will formally propose regulating e-cigarettes.

Early Thursday, the agency unveiled a long-awaited rule that would give it power to oversee the increasingly popular devices, much in the way that it regulates traditional cigarettes.

"It's a huge change," FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg told reporters in a briefing Wednesday, before the official announcement of the agency's plans. "We will have the authority as a science-based regulatory agency to take critical actions to promote and protect the health of the public."

The proposal will be subject to public comment and further review by the agency before becoming final. But once that happens the rule would impose new restrictions, including:
oA ban on the sale of e-cigarettes to minors.
oA prohibition on distributing free samples.
oA ban on selling e-cigarettes in vending machines unless they are in places that never admit young people.
oA requirement that e-cigarettes carry warnings that they contain nicotine, which is addictive.
oE-cigarette manufacturers would be required to disclose the ingredients in their products.

E-cigarettes are plastic or metal tubes about the size of a traditional cigarette that heat a liquid solution containing nicotine. That creates a vapor that users inhale. Their popularity has soared in recent years.

Some have welcomed the trend as a way to prevent people from smoking traditional cigarettes, which are far more dangerous, and to help smokers quit.

Others fear the devices will addict nonsmokers to nicotine and eventually lead to more people smoking. That has fueled calls for the FDA to assert its authority over the devices. Although e-cigarettes are generally considered much safer than traditional cigarettes, some fear that not enough research has been done to know what risks they may have.

"We call the current marketplace for e-cigarettes the Wild Wild West," said Mitchell Zeller, who heads the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. "We will be in a position to ensure that the products are as safe as they could possibly be."

The FDA had previously attempted to regulate e-cigarettes, but that effort was thwarted in court. The agency recently signaled, however, that it planned to try again. Thursday's announcement will make that official.

The proposal would also require any new e-cigarettes to get FDA approval before being sold, and demand that current products provide a justification for remaining on the market.

The announcement stopped short of more aggressive regulation that some critics had called for, including restricting or banning fruit flavors and other sweet flavors that may appeal to young people.

It also will not restrict television advertising and online sales, as some had hoped. But Zeller and Hamburg said Thursday's move is the first step that could lead to such measures if the agency determines that is needed.

"This announcement starts the process that will give us the authority to actually get out there and regulate e-cigarettes," Hamburg said.

The FDA also is proposing regulation of a variety of other tobacco-related products, including cigars, nicotine gels, pipe tobacco and water pipes.

E-Cigarettes to Fall Under FDA Review as Popularity Grows

Makers of electronic cigarettes such as Lorillard Inc. (LO:US) and Altria Group Inc. will for the first time face regulatory oversight, including passing a review to stay on the market, under a U.S. plan that doesn't ban TV ads or flavored versions of the new products. 

The Food and Drug Administration today said it planned to extend its reach over the tobacco industry to include the $3 billion market for e-cigarettes such as NJOY and blu, as well as cigars. The rules, if finalized, will limit sales to minors, ban free samples and require nicotine addiction warnings. 

Consumer groups have said e-cigarette companies use candy flavors, TV ads and music festival sponsorships to target youth, who doubled their use of the products in 2012 from a year earlier. Agency officials called today's proposal a foundation that may lead to tighter control in the future.

"For the first time there will be a science-based, independent regulatory agency providing gatekeeping," Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a briefing. "The regulator will finally be doing its job." 

The FDA gained the authority in 2009 to regulate e-cigarettes and cigars. The latest plan, open to public comment for 75 days, would require e-cigarette and cigar manufacturers to give the agency ingredient lists as well. The rules also will apply to pipe tobacco and hookah tobacco. 

The agency is assessing available research on flavors in e-cigarettes, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said.

"We're prepared for responsible regulation," Andries Verleur, chief executive officer and co-founder of Miami-based V2 Cigs, said in an interview before the proposal was made public. "Anything that would stifle innovation or accessibility we'll stand firmly against. I can say with certainty the electronic cigarette is not going anywhere." 

'Massive Impact' 

While Verleur said regulatory review requirements "could have a massive impact financially," he favors prohibiting sales to those younger than 18. 

Most e-cigarettes deliver nicotine while leaving out the tars, arsenic and other chemicals common in tobacco products. The tubular devices, which produce an inhalable vapor to mimic smoking, were added at the end of last year to a New York ban on smoking in restaurants, bars, offices and parks. Chicago and Los Angeles followed with similar prohibitions. 

Graham Hubert, a 29-year-old set builder in New York, used traditional smokes for 10 years before switching to e-cigarettes. He views them as an alternative that may have fewer side effects. 

"I'm concerned about the little bit, that we don't know much about the long-term side effects," Hubert said. "But I do know the long-term side effects of smoking, so I rather be smoking an e-cigarette." 

He said e-cigarettes should be regulated similarly to regular cigarettes, especially in banning sales to minors. 

'Limit Addiction' 

"When you're a young person there should be a way to limit the amount of addiction you have," Hubert said. "I didn't smoke when I was a teenager. Why make something available to a kid that they don't need." 

Cigarettes already must meet FDA review standards, maintain minimum age requirements and display warnings. Traditional smokes, though, are also banned from online sales, TV advertising, sponsorship and the use of flavors. Menthol is permitted while the ingredient is under FDA review. 

The industry may choose to sue the FDA to fight the proposal. Zeller said he's confident the agency would be able to back up their regulatory attempt with science. 

Regulatory Power 

While companies such as Altria and Reynolds American Inc. (RAI:US) have been under the FDA's authority since Congress gave the agency power over the $90 billion tobacco industry in 2009, e-cigarettes and cigars haven't been subject to the same oversight. The industry has flourished with sales tripling last year to $1.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Industries. 

The law passed about five years ago "and a lot has happened on a lot of different tobacco products without any regulatory activity by the FDA," Gregg Haifley, associate director of federal relations with the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network, said before the proposal was released. "We're disappointed that it has taken this long." 

Industry sales may reach $5 billion in 2015, according to Bloomberg Industries, which had previously predicted $6 billion in sales but lowered the figure to reflect growing bans on where they can be smoked.

Smaller Companies 

Verleur of V2 Cigs said he anticipates the new regulation will push smaller companies that haven't invested in quality controls out of the market and lead to consolidation. 

New products and those that want to stay on the market will be subject to FDA review, according to the proposal. New cigarettes that have gained FDA clearance have used a pathway that allows companies to compare them with products that were for sale before Feb. 15, 2007. 

E-cigarettes, an industry that only took off a few years ago, may not be able to identify products marketed before the date. Zeller said the comment period will help the agency determine if anything is comparable or whether e-cigarette makers might be put through a more arduous clearance process. Once the regulation is final, manufacturers will have two years to submit an application for FDA review and will be allowed to continue sales while the agency makes a determination. 

The FDA also is asking for comment on whether premium cigars should be included in the agency's regulation, Zeller said. He wouldn't say when the proposal might become final. 

Enticing Children 

Advocacy groups that fight cancer are concerned flavored e-cigarettes and cigars as well as stylish advertising is attracting children to use the products as a gateway to cigarettes, Haifley said in an interview. The share of U.S. students in middle school and high school who used e-cigarettes in 2012 doubled to 10 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Youth Tobacco Survey released in September. 

"It presents serious problems in the smoke-free context and it is potentially undercutting the whole social norm," Haifley said. "All the sudden having people behaving like they're smoking, what kind of social message does that send to kids?" 

Executives at e-cigarette companies argue their products are aimed at current smokers as a cigarette alternative. Though most don't say the products can help traditional smokers quit -- which would require stricter FDA regulation as a drug product. 

"The potential for removing combustion from the smoking process can have such an impact on public health and also the economics of public health because of the number of people who suffer from smoking complications," Verleur said.
