Unless you happen to be living under a rock, you already know that Toronto Blue Jays fans were forced to say sayonara (for now) to fan favourite and generally all-around awesome human being Munenori Kawasaki last night. With the incredible Jose Reyes finally back on the Blue Jays active roster Kawasaki became the latest victim of this season's "options" game.

I don't really want to get into whether or not it was the right decision by the club. There has already been much debate on Twitter and radio talk shows this morning about the move. Rather I wanted to honour the little dynamo for bringing life to our franchise on even the gloomiest of days in April and May. His antics and general zeal for life made fans everywhere remember that as much as we love baseball, it's still just a game.

After attending the game on Saturday for what could be one of Kawasaki's last appearances in Toronto, I left with a renewed fondness for Mune. I was at the game with my girlfriend who had never been to SkyDome before. Every time Kawasaki came up to bat and the stadium roared she had to ask "who is this guy?"

I'm known as a "numbers" guy to many of our readers, but I fell in love with sports for the general excitement and joy that they bring me to watch and play. And I can't help appreciating what Munenori Kawasaki brought to the diamond every night, baseball ability not included.

To me Kawasaki seems to symbolize the constant debate between Jays fans about who is a "real" baseball fan and who is just on the bandwagon. To me it's never really mattered, as long as you are cheering the Blue Jays on! While pundits and fans may differ on his value as a player on the field, most everyone can agree he's always awesome whether or not he's actually hitting the baseball.

From Blue Jays fans everywhere - thank you Kawasaki!
