No U-turn in taking wrestling from death list to Olympic shortlist, says IOC

Did the International Olympic Committee make a U-turn in putting wrestling -- voted off the list of Olympic core sports in February -- on the shortlist for the 2020 Olympics?

Did the International Olympic Committee reverse itself - and make a U-turn - by putting wrestling on its shortlist of three sports for consideration for the 2020 Olympics less than four months after eliminating the sport from its roster of core sports?



On Friday, IOC president Jacques Rogge said no.
 
"I don't see any shortcomings in the system, I don't see any errors in the system," said Rogge at the end of a three-day meeting of the IOC Executive Board in St Petersburg, Russia, which, on Wednesday, had voted wrestling, along with squash and a combined baseball-softball bid, to a shortlist of sports which will be considered by the entire IOC in Buenos Aires, Argentina in September.
 
"We do not want change for change," Rogge added. "The purpose is to have the best possible Olympic Games."
 
In seeking to make the Olympics more attractive to younger-generation fans and sponsors - while also maintaining a limit of 28 sports and approximately 10,500 participating athletes that has held fast since the 2000 Sydney Olympics -- the IOC invited some newer sports such as inline skating, sport climbing, and wakeboarding to put forth bids for one open spot on the 2020 and 2024 Olympic sports roster. These sports, along with karate and the Chinese martial art of wushu, and the three on the eventual shortlist, made 30-minute presentations to the IOC Executive Board on Wednesday.
 
After the IOC announced that wrestling - a sport that traces its roots back to 708 B.C., and was one of the original sports of the first Modern Olympics in 1896 - had survived the first round of cuts on Wednesday, some questioned the reversal of decision. Or, to put the issue in starker terms, why would the IOC eliminate a sport in February, only to put it back into consideration in May?
 
It has been argued that the IOC saw the error in its ways in eliminating wrestling. Or, perhaps the IOC, stung by the overwhelmingly negative reaction to the decision worldwide - including outright mockery, and suggestions of shady politics -- sought out a face-saving way out of its decision from earlier this year. 

Rogge addressed the matter on Friday. He brushed aside suggestions that, if the entire IOC membership were to vote in September to return wrestling to the Olympics, it would have erased the entire purpose of eliminating the sport in the first place back in February.
 
"If there is the consideration that one sport is better than the other it should be chosen even if it is an existing sport," said the IOC president, who has served in that position for twelve years, and whose term is to expire this fall. "Do not bring a new one in for the sake of a new one."
 
Rogge cited rule changes and other reforms implemented by FILA, the international wrestling federation, just two weeks ago.
 
"If you look at the reaction of the federation to their admitted shortcomings, the international federation drastically changed its own governance, including (installing) women in the executive board -- which was a criticism of the report from the IOC -- changing the format of the competition, changing the presentation," said Rogge.
 
A week after FILA revealed new rules to make the sport more fan-friendly and action-oriented - along with changes to open new opportunities for women on the mat and in governing the organization -- Rogge said, "I think they had the good answer and the good reaction. They obviously were taken a bit by a surprise by the fact they could leave the core group."
 
"The federation definitely understood the reasons why they were ousted, and they reacted what they normally should have done."
 
Rogge admitted that the IOC would have been criticized had it axed a sport other than wrestling from the Olympic roster.
 
"Had we decided to eliminate another sport from the core sports, such as modern pentathlon, we would have been criticized for having betrayed the legacy of Pierre de Coubertin, who invented the sport." (de Coubertin is considered to be the father of the Modern Olympics.)
 
"Had we decided to eliminate taekwondo, we would have been accused of betraying the spirit of Asian sport, I mean we would have had criticism for any sport that would have been eliminated."
 
The man who may take Rogge's job this fall also weighed in.
 
IOC Vice-President Thomas Bach, considered to be the frontrunner among six candidates to succeed Rogge as president this fall, said, "Wrestling gave a very good presentation. You could clearly see they got the message. They took the right decisions. Sometimes for great reforms you need pressure."

Russia's Putin backs Olympic return for wrestling

ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin backed a return to the Olympics for wrestling on Thursday, saying it was one of the fundamental sports of the Games.
 
Wrestling was controversially taken off the 2020 Olympics program in February by the International Olympic Committee but was thrown a lifeline on Wednesday, making a shortlist along with squash and baseball/softball for one spot at the 2020 Games.
 
"I know that the final decision will be made later. But now we have decided on the three sports, there is also wrestling, a favorite in 209 countries around the world," Putin said in a meeting with IOC President Jacques Rogge.
 
"Hopefully, the decision will ultimately be fair, reasonable and will serve to strengthen and develop the Olympic movement, which was based always on ancient tradition, and wrestling as we know, is one of the fundamental sports, traditional for the Olympic Games," said Putin.
 
Russia is one of the sport's powerhouses and wrestling has been part of all modern Games since 1896, apart from 1900.
 
The IOC will elect the new sport at its session in September.
 
Putin had earlier attended a sports conference, touring the stands with Rogge and getting a glimpse of the Sochi 2014 winter Games medals, unveiled earlier in the day.
 
The Russian president had also helped his country land their first ever winter Olympics, appearing and speaking in English at Sochi's final presentation at the IOC session in Guatemala in 2007.
