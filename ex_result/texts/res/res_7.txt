One of the midstate's fiercest mat rivalries was renewed last season, and it wasn't without plenty of fireworks.

Boiling Springs hosted Big Spring in a match the Bubblers were supposed to own the upper hand. It was Class AA versus Class AAA, neighboring schools in a controlled environment featuring kids that know each other well.

In this case, Class AAA secured bragging rights.

The Bulldogs won the last nine matches on the road and bested the Bubblers 43-23. Rod Wright's squad has had a year to stew about it and will be looking for redemption when the two teams meet at 7 p.m. Thursday.

PennLive and "High School Sports Live" have local fans covered. The match will be live streamed on pennlive.com and can be seen on ABC 27.2 RTV, Comcast 246, Verizon 461, Blue Ridge 152 and Kuhn 67.

The Bubblers are coming off a decisive win over Bermudian Springs and sit atop the District 3-AA power rankings. The Bulldogs are fifth on the Class AAA side and had a successful trip to Escape the Rock last week.

Possible match-ups to watch for are the Bubblers Kyle Shoop squaring off against the Bulldogs Greg Warner, or Class AA standout Kyle Taylor opposite Tommy Rayhart, who is back in the Bulldogs lineup after battling mononucleosis.
