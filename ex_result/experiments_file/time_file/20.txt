Murdoch faces fight for media rival
Rupert Murdoch could "push himself to the limit" to try to buy rival Time Warner, but is likely to face stiff resistance from the company's board, it was claimed on Thursday.
An initial $US80 billion ($A86.6 billion) cash and shares offer by Murdoch's 21st Century Fox was spurned, but some experts believe he could afford to up this to more than $US94 billion ($A101.7 billion).
Time Warner, owner of CNN as well as the Harry Potter franchise, has said it had no further interest in talks.
Claire Enders, of Enders Analysis, said the rejection was "unequivocal" and contained no tell-tale language regarding the value of the proposal that could be seen as inviting an increased attempt.

She said any deal was "not going to be easy," but suggested Murdoch, 83, was not likely to back down.
"When he gets a bee in his bonnet, he'll go through with it. He is going to push himself to the limit to get this company," she said.
"The more they disengage, the more he is going to be keen to get them."
Enders also suggested the "profoundly liberal" Time Warner was likely to baulk at the idea of having to dispense with its "crown jewel" of CNN if acquired by the owner of its combative rival Fox News.
The initial offer for Time Warner reportedly valued it at $US85 per share, but Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente said 21st Century Fox could afford to borrow more money to fund a deal at more than $US100 and still see the transaction add to profits next year.
Time Warner's holdings include cable channel HBO, maker of True Blood and Game Of Thrones, as well as news broadcaster CNN and Warner Bros, owner of Harry Potter, Batman and The Hangover.
21st Century Fox includes Fox News and the Fox network behind The Simpsons and Family Guy, as well as Hollywood studio Twentieth Century Fox, maker of the X-Men and Ice Age films. It also owns a large chunk of BSkyB.
