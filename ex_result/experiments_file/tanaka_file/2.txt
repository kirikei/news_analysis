Who will step up in the absence of Masahiro Tanaka? | NJ.com
CLEVELAND - As the Yankees attempt to pick up in the pieces in the aftermath of the devastating loss of ace Masahiro Tanaka for at least six weeks with a partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his throwing arm, someone has to step up.
General manager Brian Cashman has vowed to continue to be aggressive in the trade market, but the Yankees must look in-house in the immediate future.
Rookie Shane Greene (1-0) stepped up Monday night in his first major-league start and earned a start on Saturday in Baltimore. Newly-acquired Brandon McCarthy turned in a workman-like performance Wednesday in his Yankees' debut.
Veteran Hiroki Kuroda (6-6, 4.20), who'll start on Friday against the Orioles, is the last man standing from the Yankees' initial starting rotation.
Thursday night, it was right-hander David Phelps, who pitched six strong innings before the bullpen unraveled in a 9-3 loss to the Indians at Progress Field.
Phelps, converted reliever, allowed seven hits and two runs over six-plus innings, departing in the seventh inning with two on and no outs. Both runners scored as Matt Thornton gave up a three-run triple to Asdrubal Cabrera.
"The first six innings were good," said Phelps, who is 3-4 with a 3.94 ERA in 14 starts. "It's frustrating I didn't finish it. Just throwing strikes and getting ahead of guys and not letting them get back in the count."
Entering Thursday night's game, Phelps was 2-0 with a 3.16 ERA in his previous four starts, beating heavy-hitting Oakland and Toronto.
"He has been really, really good," Girardi said. "Unfortunately, we weren't able to win the game for him."
