NBA free agent rumors: LeBron James heads back to Miami on plane with Dwyane Wade, per report | NJ.com
Those waiting outside of LeBron James house might want to head back home, because the tide may be turning.
After spending the past few days in Las Vegas at his annual basketball camp, James reportedly got on a plane Thursday night to head back to Miami -- and guess who was on that plane with him?
Dwyane Wade expected to be on a flight back to Miami with LeBron James tonight, league sources told Yahoo. They had been together in Vegas.

James has been spending plenty of time with his (former?) teammate recently, as the two have been in Las Vegas at the same time and had dinner earlier in the week. Wade also showed up to a practice at James' camp on Thursday, watching the high-school students play with James.

So what does the two spending so much time together mean?
It certainly doesn't appear to be a good sign for Cavalier fans that James has been hanging out with Wade right as he is supposedly going to leave him for another team. It is also hard to imagine that after Wade opted out of a contract that was going to pay him $42 million over the next two seasons, and then James left anyway, the two would be on such friendly terms.
Anything is possible, and at this point of the circus, everything is being read into. But for the first time in what seems like a few days, it now looks like the tide might be turning back to Miami.
