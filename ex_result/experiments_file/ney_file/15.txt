Brazil's Neymar runs past Cameroon's Joel Matip after scoring his side's first goal during the group A World Cup soccer match between Cameroon and Brazil at the Estadio Nacional in Brasilia, Brazil
The immensely talented Neymar was in his element as his predatory skills ensured that he struck twice as Brazil walloped Cameroon 4-1 to finish on top of group A as they set up a pre quarter-final date with Chile, who lost 0-2 to the Netherlands in FIFA World Cup yesterday.
By virtue of finishing on top of group B, the Dutchman sailed into the Round of 16 where they would meet a dangerous Mexico which demolished Croatia 3-1 with late burst.
In an inconsequential match of the day, World Champions Spain finished their engagements with a consolation 3-0 win over Australia.
Brazil were always overwhelming favourites against the 'Indomitable Lions' who have had a forgettable World Cup this time. Their coach rightly benched a horribly out of form Samuel Eto'o but nothing changed for the African side.
Neymar struck twice in the 17th and 34th minute while striker Fred headed home in the 49th minute. Fernandinho completed the rout with an 84th minute strike.
For Cameroon, Matip had equalised in the 26th minute but they could only prevent Brazil for eight minutes before they again surged ahead.
For Mexico, a draw was enough but a 10-minute blitz from 72nd to 82nd minute saw them fire home thrice with their inspirational skipper Rafael Marquez breaking the deadlock in the 72 minute.
Andres Guardado scored within another three minutes before Javier Hernandez rounded off the tally in the 82nd minute. Ivan Perisic got a consolation goal at the fag end of the match.
