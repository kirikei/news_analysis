The British Open Championship 2014: live - Telegraph
World No 2 Stenson - who can overtake Adam Scott at the top of the rankings this week - is rated a 16/1 third favourite behind Scott and England's Justin Rose, winner of his last two events.
"The Open Championship is a highlight of any season and for any player I think, especially European born ones," said Stenson, who finished second to Phil Mickelson at Muirfield last year and third in both 2010 and 2008.
Stenson's runner-up finish last year was part of an amazing second half of the season, which saw him become the first man to win the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup and European Tour's Race to Dubai in the same season.
The 38-year-old banked a USD 10million bonus for his FedEx Cup triumph, secured in style with victory in the Tour Championship in Atlanta, while also winning more than PS3m in Europe.
"I know I would be the first Swedish man to win a major. But for me it's more about winning a major. If one of my Swedish colleagues can do it before me, well done to them. I'm just looking at trying to get one for myself."
Woods of course has won 14 for himself, but none since the 2008 US Open. The 38-year-old has played just two competitive rounds since March - missing the cut in his comeback event at Congressional - but can at least draw on his stunning performance at Hoylake in 2006.
