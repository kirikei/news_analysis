Derek Jeter mania gives MLB its most watched All-Star game since 2010 | Big League Stew - Yahoo Sports
We tuned in to see if Derek Jeter had one more great All-Star game in him. We stayed for the Adam Wainwright controversy, for Mike Trout's emergence on the national stage and for the hometown Twins ending the night in fitting fashion.
But mostly people tuned in Tuesday night to see Derek Jeter. And it paid dividends in the ratings.
The 2014 MLB All-Star game attracted 11.34 million viewers and a 7.0 rating for FOX, according to Nielsen, that's up from 11 million (and a 6.9 rating) in 2013. It also represents the biggest audience since 2010 for an MLB All-Star game. That game brought in 12.1 million viewers, and it took place on the day former New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner died.
According to Maury Brown at Forbes, the rating increase also made for a ratings achievement that MLB hasn't seen in 20 years:
Given that the household rating for last year's game increased from 2012 (6.9 vs. 6.8), this marks the first time that the MLB All-Star Game has posted ratings increases in consecutive years since 1993 and 1994. The MLB All-Star Game is the highest-rated All-Star event among major sports this year (Pro Bowl is No. 2 at 6.6/10).
While it's nice the MLB All-Star game can grab more television eyes than the NFL's ho-hum Pro Bowl, it's still not in the same galaxy as the Super Bowl, which set a record in February with 111.5 million viewers.
