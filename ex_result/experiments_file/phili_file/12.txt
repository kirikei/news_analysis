'Glenda' exits but brewing cyclone may enter Phl within 24 hours | Headlines, News, The Philippine Star | philstar.com
MANILA, Philippines -- Typhoon "Glenda" is now out of the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) but a potential tropical cyclone has moved closer to the country, the state weather bureau said Thursday.
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said "Glenda" was located at 480 kilometers west of Dagupan City at 8 a.m.
The weather bureau, however, also said that the low pressure area (LPA) hovering over the Pacific Ocean is now at 940 kilometers east of northern Mindanao.
In an interview with ANC, PAGASA weather Aldczar Aurelio said the LPA is expected to enter PAR within 24 hours.
The Joint Typhoon Watch Center (JTWC) of the US Department of Defense also said in an update that the formation of a significant tropical cyclone is possible.
It said that the sea surface temperatures in the area of the weather system are conducive for the development of a cyclone.
"The potential for the development of a significant tropical cyclone within the next 24 hours is high," the Hawaii-based weather bureau said.
The JTWC said winds in the area of the brewing cyclone are estimated at 28 kilometers per hour (kph) to 37 kph.
The new weather system is moving westward at 4 kph, the agency added.
Meantime, PAGASA said Metro Manila, Central Luzon, CALABARZON and the Provinces of Mindoro, Palawan, La Union, Benguet and Pangasinan will have occasional rains.
The rest of the country will be partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rainshowers and thunderstorms.
Moderate to strong winds blowing from the southwest to southeast will prevail over Luzon and coming from the southwest will prevail over the rest of the country with moderate to rough seas.
