MONTREAL, Canada (AFP) -- BlackBerry stock fell sharply yesterday, one day after the announcement of a landmark deal between rivals Apple and IBM to offer custom-tailored apps for businesses.
At closing, BlackBerry shares were down nearly 12 per cent to US$9.97, after falling 6.3 per cent when the markets opened in New York.
BlackBerry helped create a culture of mobile users glued to smartphones, but consumers have moved in droves to iPhones and devices using Google's Android software.
The deal between Apple and IBM seemed likely to hasten the Waterloo, Ontario-based company's demise.
After posting record losses last year, BlackBerry brought in new management and outsourced its handset production to Taiwan-based Foxconn.
The company said it sold 2.6 million smartphones in the last quarter. Hardware sales accounted for 39 per cent of its revenues, while services grew to 54 per cent. The remainder came from software and other sources.
