ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Maryland’s film tax credit program is getting some edits in the Senate.
On Wednesday senators approved an amendment to extend the program indefinitely, but leaves funding to the discretion of the governor and the state’s Department of Business and Economic Development.
Late last year, the state’s Department of Legislative Services issued a report saying the program should keep its fiscal 2016 termination date, because vying for film projects can become competitive and also unpredictable for states.
Supporters of the tax credit say the goal of the program is not to make money, but help Maryland’s economy.
The state provided $62.5 million in tax credits between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, mostly for two shows, “House of Cards” and the HBO program “VEEP.”
