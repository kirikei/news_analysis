FBI, Police Find No Threat on EVA Air Plane at LA Airport
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Inside
LOS ANGELES —  Someone called in a threat to a flight from Taiwan that landed at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday, but nothing dangerous was found on board, authorities said.
The plane was inspected and its passengers' luggage was screened as EVA Air Flight 12 sat on the tarmac at LAX, but there was no evidence of a threat, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.
The FBI, airport police and the Los Angeles police bomb squad jointly investigated the threat, which came by telephone. The investigation into the person or group responsible was ongoing.
The flight landed at LAX as scheduled at about 3:40 p.m. Eimiller said passengers were escorted off the plane to Tom Bradley International Terminal, their luggage was screened, and the plane was swept by bomb-sniffing dogs.
The threat came a day after at least half a dozen other threats were made by phone to international flights at airports in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
Authorities said Monday's threats may have come from the same source and did not turn out to be credible.
In one case, U.S. military jets escorted an Air France flight into New York City after someone claimed a chemical weapon was aboard the aircraft, the FBI said.
