DFW AIRPORT (WBAP/KLIF 24/7 NEWS) – A runway that had been closed because of a nearby sinkhole has reopened at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. Crews determined the cause of the erosion came from a storm drain that became dislodged from a larger storm drain.
The erosion is not expected to cause any problems to the runway and crews are preparing to excavate and make repairs to the drain itself.
A statement from the airport reports the integrity of Runway 18L is intact and the runway is unaffected by the erosion.
