MDMA therapy trials approved for San Fransisco study
A team of therapists in Marin County in California has just been granted permission to begin MDMA-assisted therapy trials. This follows news that the the DEA approved MDMA-assisted therapy and will begin to disclose the benefits or downfalls to using the popular drug as a part of therapy.
Dr. Philip Wolfson is a psychiatrist who has begun recruiting 18 people as patients for his research project, which will be conducted over the next year at his hilltop psychotherapy center that overlooks Mount Tamalpais. The therapy program is taking part in the fight to reclassify federally-defined ecstasy as more than a drug that has zero medical value. The trials hope to show MDMA’s powerful ability to help survivors of major trauma cope and recover from PTSD and other trauma-related disorders.
Dr. Wolfson is still recruiting for the MDMA-assisted therapy, but volunteers must “be at least 18 years old and have been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness of a noncardiac nature. They must have at least nine months of life expectancy and be experiencing significant levels of anxiety.” For more information on the study, you can call (877) 372-2692 or e-mail sf@mdmasites.org . Additionally, if you’re in the San Fransisco area on June 4th, you can hear Dr. Wolfson give a public speech titled “MDMA and the Science of Psychedelic Therapy — The Great Adventure” at the First Unitarian Church at 7:30pm.
“MDMA is the most inherently healing of the psychedelic drugs,” said Rick Doblin, the executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. What do you think-does MDMA have the potential to work in therapy or is it a bunch of bologna? Let us know in the comments.
