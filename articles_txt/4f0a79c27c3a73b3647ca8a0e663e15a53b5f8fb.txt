BOISE, Idaho — Idaho lawmakers are remaining hopeful that they will be able to find a viable solution to address the state's transportation funding shortfall despite lengthy delays and multiple failed proposals.
However, as the Idaho Legislature nears its final days, tensions over what can actually get done are rising.
House legislative leaders are advocating for an aggressive tax cut to pair with a transportation funding backfill measure. But Senate lawmakers rejected the House's aggressive three-part tax plan earlier this week. Instead, they are in the middle of amending a much simpler bill focusing solely on creating new transportation revenue.
This has resulted in a standoff between the two chambers. Lawmakers took the day off Friday to give themselves time to regroup for Monday.
