Sen. Rob Portman is a famous fan of the Cincinnati Reds, and Monday being opening day for the 2015 MLB season, he went to the ballpark.
The Ohio Republican is running for re-election in 2016, and he’s facing Ted Strickland, the former Democratic Ohio governor who lost to Gov. John Kasich in 2010.
Heading to the @Reds #OpeningDay parade soon. Looking forward to seeing many of you there.
Courtesy of an Ohio source, here’s a photo of a Democratic operative who’s been trailing and filming the senator for months.
In campaign jargon, he’s known as a “tracker,” one of the guys employed to catch politicians on camera saying bad things which can later be turned into attack ads featuring those bad things. It’s perfectly routine in modern politics for trackers to accompany politicians to basically every public event.
But less routine is for a tracker to rock a Pittsburgh Pirates ensemble while filming a famed Cincinnati Reds fan at opening day for the Reds.
Cincinnati’s opponent Monday?
The Pittsburgh Pirates.
Reds and Pirates are scoreless after the first. #JohnnyBeisbol back on the mound. #RedsOpeningDay
