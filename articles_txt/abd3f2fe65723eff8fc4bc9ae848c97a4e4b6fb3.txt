SAN DIEGO (KUSI) - A photo of two young girls with cancer hugging at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh has gone viral.
In early May, Tazz Jones snapped a photo of her daughter Maliyah hugging her friend Madelina DeLuca.
She posted the image on her Facebook, calling it “the perfect example of love,” and asked people to share the picture around the world.“[Madelina] and Maliyah clicked as if they knew one another for some time,” Jones told ABC News. “At that moment I starred [sic] in awe! I wondered what they were feeling; what they were thinking and how they felt.”
According to Tazz Jones, Maliyah has been battling Stage 4 Neuroblastoma since she was 2 years old. She is now 5. Madelina, 2, was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Luekemia, but according to her mother's Facebook page, she has ended her chemotherapy treatments.
