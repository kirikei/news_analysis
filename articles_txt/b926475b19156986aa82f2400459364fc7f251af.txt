Gov. Rick Scott's top elections official came under intense criticism Wednesday for fighting the Legislature's plan to allow people in Florida to register to vote online by 2017.Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Scott appointee, appeared before House and Senate committees to oppose the idea, calling online registration a "flashing yellow light" fraught with security risks....
"You didn't have to come today. You weren't invited to come," said Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, glaring at Detzner. "I think the patience of the Legislature on this issue has been stretched."
Pasco County Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley heaped more criticism on Detzner, whose shaky relations with county supervisors may have worsened as a result of his opposition...."This might be a new low in a lack of credibility for the Department of State as it relates to this issue," Corley said, calling Detzner "impotent" for erecting roadblocks that other states have implemented "seamlessly."
