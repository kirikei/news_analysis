At least 800 people have died in a major heatwave that has swept across India, melting roads in New Delhi as temperatures neared 50 degrees Celsius.
With no end in sight to the searing conditions, hospitals have been on alert to treat victims of heatstroke and authorities have advised people to stay indoors. In the worst-hit state of Andhra Pradesh, in the south, 551 people have died in the last week as temperatures hit 47 degrees Celsius on Monday.
The state government has passed messages on television and other media to tell people not to venture outside without a cap and to drink water.
Large parts of India, including the capital New Delhi, have endured days of sweltering heat, prompting fears of power cuts as energy-guzzling air conditioners work overtime.
