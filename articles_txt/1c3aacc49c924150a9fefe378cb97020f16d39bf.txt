Republican Candidate Sets Up First Campaign Office In Iowa

The first Republican presidential campaign office has now been set up in Iowa.
Former Bush administration IRS commissioner Mark Everson announced Thursday that he has set up a campaign headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa. The fringe candidate announced his candidacy recently to little to no fanfare. Multiple calls to Everson headquarters during business hours Thursday were not answered.
“I respect Iowa’s traditional role of both surfacing talent and thinning the presidential field,” Everson said in a statement provided to The Daily Caller. “This election will be won by talking to the people of Iowa in farmhouses and neighborhood grocery stores, not by pandering to multimillionaire campaign donors on Wall Street.”
Political groups associated with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Dr. Ben Carson have both opened offices in Iowa , but neither have official announced their candidacy yet.
