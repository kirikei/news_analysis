The Leadership Matters for America PAC announced Thursday it's committing $100,000 of the money it has raised so far.
That includes $10,000 contributions to the Republican parties of the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina and smaller amounts to two dozen officials in other important presidential states such as Pennsylvania, Illinois and Nevada, said spokeswoman Samantha Smith.
The PAC is also contributing cash to New Jersey's six Republican members of Congress.
"Leadership Matters PAC is proud to support leaders and state parties who are working to change Washington and provide real leadership," said the PAC's senior adviser, Mike DuHaime.
Christie says he will decide in late spring to early summer whether to run for the GOP nomination.
Meantime he appears to be picking up his 2016 activities. He'll head to New Hampshire next week for town hall events and meet-and-greets.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's Right to Rise PAC, which has been raking in money, has announced two rounds of contributions to lawmakers and state parties exceeding $240,000.
