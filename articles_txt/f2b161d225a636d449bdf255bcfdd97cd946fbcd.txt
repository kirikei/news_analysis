The eldest son of math prodigy John Nash Jr. expressed his admiration for his famous father in the last conversation they shared before the Princeton professor died in a car crash on the New Jersey Turnpike.
“I said I was proud of him and congratulations and have a safe flight,” John Stier, 61, of Lynn, Mass., told The Post on Tuesday.
Stier spoke to his father for the last time on May 19 as he was leaving Norway, where he traveled to watch Nash receive an award for the Abel Prize for Mathematics.
“I saw the full ceremony and I got to see my dad just after the ceremony — and that was the last time I saw him,” he said.
The Tuesday awards ceremony took place just four days before Nash and his wife, Alicia, were fatally thrown from a taxi cab that careened into a guardrail near Interstate 8A in Monroe Township.
Stier is heading down to New Jersey in the coming days to attend a private funeral service and connect with other family members.
“There will be a well attended and public memorial event — maybe even the university will put something together,” he added.
The grief-stricken son added that the suddenness of his dad’s death is “unbelievable.”
“They had just come home from their trip to Oslo,” Stier said. “They were in good spirits and wanted to get home at that point.”
The Nashes decided to take a taxi instead of the limo they had scheduled to pick them up at Newark Airport because their flight arrived five hours early.
“You wouldn’t think it would matter if someone came home early or late and whether they got home safely,” Stier said. “It’s a rough situation.”
The MIT Club of Princeton will be paying tribute to the Nashes on Wednesday with a screening of “A Beautiful Mind” and dinner reception.
