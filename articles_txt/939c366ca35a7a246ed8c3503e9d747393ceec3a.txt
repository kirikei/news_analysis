A US airman has walked into a Wal-Mart Supercentre and opened fire with a handgun, killing one worker and injuring a second before turning the gun on himself.
POLICE in Grand Forks, North Dakota, say the shooting, just after 1am local time, may have been random, with no link yet found between 21-year-old Marcell Willis and either the store or the employees.
Willis was treated at the scene and taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
