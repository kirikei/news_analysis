No, she's not nearly suffering a windy wardrobe malfunction  on the streets of Beverly Hills, but is instead channeling the curvaceous icon on the cover of Vogue Brazil, which sees the E! beauty sporting platinum blond locks—a la the Some Like It Hot star. 
Flaunting her killer cleavage, big lips and Hollywood pin-up curls, Kanye West 's missus looks absolutely gorgeous while cementing her status as a fashion icon. This cover marks the third time she has covered the style bible ( she previously covered Vogue Australia's February issue as well as the U.S. cover in 2014).

In a second image from the shoot, the mother of one shows off her bangin' bod in a cropped black turtleneck and matching skirt, putting her killer curves on full display. 
And if you're doing a double take while glancing at the images of Kim, then you're not alone, as Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci previously dubbed the E! star a modern day Marilyn Monroe . 
"I met her as the girlfriend of a good friend," Tisci shared in 2014, referring to his close pal Kanye West. "I just wanted a moment with her to understand—and I fell in love. She's the Monroe of our age. People think she's like a doll, but actually she's tough and clever."
While it's unclear exactly when the cover was shoot, the 34-year-old stunner previously rocked the blond bombshell look earlier this year when she  dyed her hair platinum for Paris Fashion Week . 
"I did love the blond and I wish I could have kept it a little longer [but] I really wanted to go to Armenia being a brunette. I wish I had kept it a couple months longer," she told E! News less than one month ago . "I'll do it again, but I'm going to have to wait now a couple years because it just damaged my hair so much—I just need to get it back."
Be sure to tune in to the mid-season finale of Keeping Up With the Kardashian, this Sunday at 9 p.m. only on E!
