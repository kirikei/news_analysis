A day after Ben Zobrist was activated from the disabled list, Sean Doolittle was added to the roster. Zobrist is hitting third and playing second base, his first game in a month — he had been rehabbing from left knee surgery and was 5-for-16 in a five-game rehab assignment.

Doolittle said he feels “more like a complete pitcher” after working extensively on his changeup and slider while missing the first two months of the season.
“I’m not going to reinvent the wheel. I’m not going to throw knuckleballs and spit balls,” said Doolittle, who won’t immediately assume his closer’s role, which has been assumed by Tyler Clippard, who converted four of his first five save opportunities.
With Doolittle’s velocity not up to par yet, his off-speed pitches could be a big part of his repertoire.
“I know he feels better about the other pitches, so you could see a different complement from him,” manager Bob Melvin said. “If you throw 97 mph, all you have to do is show it every now and then to put a doubt in someone’s head. But if you’re not throwing that hard and sometimes when you’re coming back in the fashion he is right now, it might be more important for him to use all his pitches.”
