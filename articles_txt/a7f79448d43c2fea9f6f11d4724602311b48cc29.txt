INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Hundreds of people calling for Indiana to add protections for gays and lesbians to state civil rights laws marched through downtown Indianapolis, drawing the attention of fans attending the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament.
March organizer Dominic Dorsey II began Saturday's gathering on the city's Monument Circle by leading the crowd in chanting "Hoosiers don't discriminate! — No more Band-Aids masking hate!"
That chant referenced changes lawmakers made this week to Indiana's new religious objections law to address concerns that it would allow discrimination against gays and lesbians.
Dorsey told the crowd before they marched several blocks to the Lucas Oil Stadium, home of this year's men's Final Four,  that those changes aren't enough and lawmakers need to add protections for gays, lesbians and others to Indiana's civil rights laws.
