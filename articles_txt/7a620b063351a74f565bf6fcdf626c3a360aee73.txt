If former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seriously wants to be president of the United States, she must come out of the protective bubble in which she has encased herself.
Clinton is making her second run for the Democratic nomination for the presidency. During her first attempt in 2008, Clinton ran an aloof, disconnected campaign in which she seemed to expect to be anointed as the nominee. Then-Sen. Barack Obama ran an inspired campaign that electrified Democratic primary voters and swept the nomination out from under Clinton.
This time, Clinton is trying to position herself as the champion of ordinary people. That is a difficult play for someone who has been cut off from the lives of regular folks since 1992 — first as first lady, then U.S. senator, then secretary of state. So Clinton’s campaign handlers — perhaps at the insistence of the candidate herself — run her from one scripted event to another where hand-selected “real people” ask pre-arranged questions to which Clinton provides pat answers. The veneer of phoniness is thick even by political campaign standards.
Perhaps the protective bubble is necessary because the questions surrounding candidate Clinton are so potentially explosive.
Why were donors, particularly foreign ones, so eager to donate large sums of cash to the Clinton Foundation? Author Peter Schweizer in his book “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich” alleges there was a pay-to-play relationship between donors to the foundation and Clinton’s State Department.
What was in the tens of thousands of email messages stored on Clinton’s private server that Clinton destroyed rather than hand over to a State Department inquiry? Why was Clinton maintaining a private email server while secretary of state in violation of State Department policy? A congressional committee is now investigating. The email controversy has reignited the furor over what Clinton’s State Department knew about and how it responded to the al-Qaida attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in four American deaths.
These two issues alone have the potential to sink a presidential campaign. More importantly, they are matters on which the American public should have clear and direct answers.
Those answers are not coming from the Clinton campaign. The candidate has been avoiding the press like the plague — so much so that even Clinton’s expected natural allies in the media are beginning to take notice. The Washington Post’s website is running a clock that tallies the number of minutes since Clinton last answered a question from the press.
At one point, the counter reached 40,150 minutes — nearly 28 days.
Post reporter Chris Cillizza notes in his blog that the Clinton campaign denies Hillary is ducking the press at all. No, no, no — Clinton is asking the questions “that really matter,” the campaign insists.
What a wonderful world for politicians that would be, in which the politicians themselves get to decide which questions “matter.”
It has made for a terrible start to the Clinton campaign, one that rightly should make Democrats begin nervously to look for alternatives. So far, only Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has entered the fray. Sanders, an avowed socialist, has cheered the Democratic far left — and has Republicans rubbing their hands together with glee.
Waiting in the wings are former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley — who is all but certain to run — and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who claims she has no interest in running.
It’s not too late for Hillary Clinton to turn her campaign around. But so far, the candidate shows no recognition that her campaign is in any kind of trouble at all.
