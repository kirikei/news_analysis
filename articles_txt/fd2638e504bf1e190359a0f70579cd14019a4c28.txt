Medical marijuana has strong support among voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday.
Legalizing the drug, however, has less support, the poll found. Fifty-two percent of Ohio voters said they support legalizing possession of small amounts of cannabis. 
In Ohio, 84 percent of registered voters said they back medical marijuana,  Cleveland.com  reports. In Florida, 84 percent of voters said they'd support medical marijuana, while in 88 percent of voters in Pennsylvania said they would.
Reports Cleveland.com:
The results are significant because Ohio could see one or more issues on the November ballot from groups seeking to legalize marijuana in the state.
One of those groups, ResponsibleOhio, has already been given clearance by the state to circulate petitions and collect signatures from registered voters to try to put its issue on the ballot.
Its measure would amend the state constitution and establish a legal marijuana industry in which Ohioans could purchase marijuana for recreational and medical uses from retail outlets licensed by the state.
