The kickoff to the 2015 NFL season is still three months away, but that didn't stop Colin Kaepernick from putting himself in the news in an ugly way.
On Tuesday the 49ers quarterback posted a photo to Instagram of cars caught in floodwaters in Texas above the #7tormsComing hashtag that has, for some reason, become his trademark.
'I warned you the #7tormsComing !!! #Houston,' the caption read.
