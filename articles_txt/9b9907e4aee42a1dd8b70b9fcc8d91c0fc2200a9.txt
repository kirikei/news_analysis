PASCO, Wash. (AP) — Friday marks the two-month anniversary of an unarmed Mexican man's fatal shooting by Pasco police. Several Hispanic groups plan marches Friday and Saturday in honor of 35-year-old Antonio Zambrano-Montes .
Meanwhile, a lawyer for the victim's estranged wife and daughters on Tuesday asked Gov. Jay Inslee to reconsider his decision not to appoint a special prosecutor in the case.
The Washington Dream Act Coalition says Friday's vigil will be at the busy intersection where Zambrano-Montes was shot. Saturday, a rally and march will be held at Pasco's Volunteer Park.
Three officers are on paid administrative leave as the local investigation into the Feb. 10 shooting continues. Some residents continue to call for a federal investigation.
Pasco has seen numerous rallies since Zambrano-Montes's death. The city of 68,000 is majority Hispanic.
Attorney George Trejo Jr. of Yakima, who represents Zambrano-Montes' widow and daughters, sent a letter to Inslee's office asking the governor to reconsider his rejection of a special prosecutor in the case.
Zambrano-Montes "posed no danger to the three officers that would warrant the use of deadly force," the letter said in demanding that the officers be prosecuted.
Trejo asked that Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant be removed from the case because of conflicts of interest, and that either a state attorney be assigned or the case be referred to the U.S. Justice Department .
