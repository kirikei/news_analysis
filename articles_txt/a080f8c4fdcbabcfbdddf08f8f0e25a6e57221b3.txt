BUNKERVILLE Nev. -- Nearly one year since followers of Cliven Bundy faced off against federal rangers that forced the Bureau of Land Management to release hundreds of his cattle, he invited his followers back for a three day reunion on his ranch in Bunkerville.
The federal government has said Bundy still owes grazing fees and is still breaking the law, but now nearly one year later he's still ranching and facing no consequences.
They gathered near the Virgin River where they will be camping for the next few days.
Supporters say they were successful in helping Bundy take back his cattle from the federal government and feel the BLM has no jurisdiction in Nevada.
Bundy still owes a million dollars in grazing fees and refuses to pay. He says he's not worried about the federal government coming after him.
“For the past year we have not had that influence here on this ranch as part of clark county. We're probably the free-est place on earth at this point."
The BLM said Bundy's case is in the hands of the US attorney's office.
Bundy helped write Assembly Bill 408, which would give county sheriffs extra power on federal land.
It's a watered-down version of the original bill and passed committee this week.
