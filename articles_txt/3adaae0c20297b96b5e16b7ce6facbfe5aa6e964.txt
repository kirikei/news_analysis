And what about Rand Paul? As Benjy Sarlin reported late yesterday, there’s some behind-the-scenes drama between the group and the Republican senator.
 
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), fresh off his presidential announcement on Monday, is complaining that he was left off the speakers’ list despite boasting an “A” rating from the group.
 
It is true that the Kentucky senator has associated himself with the right-wing outfit, endorsing the group’s bizarre conspiracy theories and helping it raise money. But did this lead the NRA to become, as Paul put it “petty”? The NRA denies it .
 
“It is true we did not issue them an invite initially, but we have worked with other people who did not initially receive an invite to include them in the program,” Baker told msnbc. “Rand Paul did not reach out to us. At some point we would have reached capacity – t’s almost a 5 hour program and unfortunately you can’t accommodate everyone – but he did not come to us and ask to be included.”
