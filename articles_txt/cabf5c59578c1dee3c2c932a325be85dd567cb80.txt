LANSING, Mich. (AP) â€” All 16 members of Michigan's congressional delegation are asking the Department of Defense to locate a Cyber Operations Squadron at the Air National Guard base in Battle Creek.
The delegation says the 110th Attack Wing already has much of the infrastructure required to help lead the military cyber security initiative.
Michigan's members of Congress wrote a letter to Defense Department leaders last week.
In it, they say Michigan has 22 universities and colleges offering degrees in cyber security, including five designated as National Security Agency Centers of Excellence. The delegation says utilizing existing infrastructure would keep costs low, saving $2.2 million compared to a location without the same capabilities.
