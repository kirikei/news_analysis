BRASILIA May 26 (Reuters) - Brazil's Senate on Tuesday approved a watered-down version of an austerity measure that curbs labor benefits as part of President Dilma Rousseff's bid to restore investor confidence in her management of the country's stagnant economy.
The measure, known as provisional measure 665, was supposed to save the government 9 billion reais ($2.86 billion) a year, but amendments by lawmakers reduced that to about 5 billion reais.
This and another measure to cap some of the world's most generous pension and labor benefits are key in Rousseff's drive to balance government accounts after years of overspending that threatened Brazil's investment-grade rating.
Rousseff and her new Finance Minister Joaquim Levy have faced stiff resistance in Congress where some members of the government's coalition say the measures leave workers unprotected in the face of a looming recession.
The measure, which narrowly passed 39-32, toughens conditions for jobless Brazilians to gain access to welfare and unemployment insurance. The measure now has to be signed into law by Rousseff.     (Reporting by Alonso Soto ; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )
