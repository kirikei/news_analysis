In a new interview with Larry King , the 53-year-old singer-songwriter deemed Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act "old-fashioned," but nonetheless said he would do his "research" before he'd nix future concerts in the state.
"It's important to bring your music to the people that love you," he told King. "So if you're depriving the little gay boys and girls of Indiana of your music, then that's probably not a good thing to do."
Both Rihanna and Bleachers frontman Jack Antonoff recently spoke out against controversial "religious freedom" legislation during their respective performances in Indiana.
"You’d think they would jump at that," he said at the time. "Like, 'We’re right! We were right! Everybody just wants to be normal!' And then there’s another part of me that’s just the obnoxious gay part that thinks, Why does anyone want to get married? A friend of mine said to me recently at a party, 'Why would you want to put yourself through all of that?' But you know we have to also have to accept that there are many gay people who are very conservative and romantic and religious and I support them 100 percent."
Larry King's interview with Boy George goes live on April 8. Head here for more details.

Oregonians continually demonstrate a strong belief in fairness and equal treatment under the law. As recently as 2013, Oregon voters have defeated proposals similar to Indiana’s law, underscoring our shared values and rejecting discrimination. I encourage Oregonians to join me in expressing their concerns about this erosion of individual rights in Indiana and anywhere it may occur.
