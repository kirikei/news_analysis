PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — From his former deputy, to a top aide, to lawmakers with whom he worked, no one knew Lincoln Chafee had presidential ambitions.
The former Rhode Island governor shocked many, if not all, of his former colleagues Thursday when he announced he had formed an exploratory committee to consider a Democratic presidential campaign.
Democratic state Rep. Mia Ackerman says she can't imagine anyone not being surprised. She says there was no buzz, no whispers, nothing.
Facing poor approval ratings, Chafee decided in 2013 not to seek re-election in what would have been a difficult campaign.
Ackerman says everyone thought he'd go on to enjoy private life.
Former Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts and former Chafee chief of staff George Zainyeh also say they had no idea Chafee was considering a 2016 run.
