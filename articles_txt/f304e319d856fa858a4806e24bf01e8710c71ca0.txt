MIAMI (AP) — A South Florida federal judge has rejected a bid by two women to join a high-profile sexual abuse lawsuit that included scandalous accusations against Britain's Prince Andrew and a prominent U.S. lawyer.
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra issued his ruling Tuesday in the case involving wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein . The two women, identified as Jane Does No. 3 and No. 4, claim to be among dozens of women Epstein sexually abused as teenagers.
They wanted to join a lawsuit filed by other alleged Epstein victims seeking to reopen a non-prosecution agreement Epstein reached with federal prosecutors. Epstein was convicted of state sex offenses and served a 13-month jail sentence.
Marra also ordered sensational allegations against Prince Andrew and lawyer Alan Dershowitz stricken from the court record. Both denied any wrongdoing.
