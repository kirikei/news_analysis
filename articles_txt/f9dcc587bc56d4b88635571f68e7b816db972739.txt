Consider this...Bad laws propose keeping citizens in the dark - KCBD NewsChannel 11 Lubbock

If a bill amended by state Senator Charles Perry had passed the Texas House of Representatives, you would no longer be able to know most of the details of accidents on public roadways.
Perry claimed his amendment of House Bill 2633 was to prevent the "revictimization" of those involved.
Local journalists use motor vehicle accident reports to identify roadway hazards and serious incidents involving members of the public, in some cases leading to governmental action.
Consider this...
The Firestone tire series leading to a major recall of defective tires was produced by KHOU in Houston. Such reporting would not have been possible with Perry's amendment.
But that doesn't answer the question as to why Lubbock's senator is proposing an unconstitutional law that empowers government and violates conservative principles of transparency and openness.
The good news is that the language provided by Senator Perry was found unconstitutional and was stripped from this bill.
