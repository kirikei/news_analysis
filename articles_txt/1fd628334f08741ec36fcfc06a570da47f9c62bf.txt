For the first time in years, more teenagers are using tobacco products. But it is not cigarettes or cigars. Instead, they are smoking electronic cigarettes, otherwise known as e-cigarettes.
According to the New York Times , a report shows that 400,000 additional young people used a tobacco product in 2014, making a total of 4.6 million. This is the first increase in this statistic in years, though scientists did note that this numbers falls within the margin of error. Furthermore, the number of teenagers smoking electronic cigarettes is more than the number of traditional cigarette smokers.
The increase in e-cigarette use has also spread to the general population. In the United Kingdom, the Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) reports that the number of electronic cigarette smokers has tripled from 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014.
As this number continues to rise, governments and health institutions are scrambling to figure out the health ramifications of e-cigarettes. Initial reports indicate that e-cigarettes, such as the Pax 2, are healthier than tobacco. While they burn a vapor, they do not produce cigarette smoke.
But e-cigarettes still produce nicotine, which is what gets individuals hooked to tobacco. CDC director Tom Frieden has noted that “Nicotine exposure at a young age may cause lasting harm to brain development, promote addiction, and lead to sustained tobacco use.”
While anti-tobacco advocates like Frieden worry that e-cigarette use may be a gateway into smoking, they may be a gateway for smokers to stop. The ASH has noted that the percentage of current or former smokers who have tried e-smoking has risen from 8.2 percent in 2010 to over 51.7 percent in 2014.
Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of ASH, has declared that “there is no evidence from our research that e-cigarettes are acting as a gateway into smoking.”
Some governments are taking pre-emptive efforts to ban e-cigarette sales to children. In Michigan, the state Senate recently approved a bill prohibiting the sale of e-cigarettes to minors. Several states including Arkansas and New Hampshire have banned e-cigarette use at public educational facilities.
Tobacco smoking continues to kill over 6 million people across the world every year, with 600,000 deaths resulting from second-hand smoke inhalation.
