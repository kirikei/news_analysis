AUSTIN (KXAN) — Some lawmakers want to make sure Texas doesn’t feel the backlash of bills that could discriminate against gays and lesbians. A Dallas-area representative says there are at least 20 bills that would allow, promote or even require discrimination. The lone conservative at a news conference on Tuesday said Texas needs to stay out of the headlines.
“I think given what’s transpired in Indiana, many people have wakened to the problems that will result from this misguided legislation,” said Bill Hammond, Texas Association of Business president. “So much damage has been done to that state it will be hard to repair. We certainly don’t want that to happen in Texas.”
One bill we’ve told you about would ban state funding for marriage licenses to same-sex couples. That bill sits in committee and has not come up for a vote.
As for the bills that made national headlines, the governors of both Indiana and Arkansas ordered lawmakers to change the bills. Both states’ laws now have protections, making sure businesses cannot discriminate against gays and lesbians.
