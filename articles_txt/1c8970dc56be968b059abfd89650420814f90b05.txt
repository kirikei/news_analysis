The state of Michigan managed to avoid the scourge of chronic wasting disease (CWD) that has plagued deer and elk in 23 other states – until now.
Today, the Michigan departments of Natural Resources (DNR) and Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) confirmed a free-ranging deer in Meridian Township of Ingham County has tested positive for CWD.
If more deer turn out to be infected, it could have far-reaching financial and social implications. The disease is caused by prions, similar to Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis (mad cow disease), but it affects white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk and moose.
Chronic wasting disease hasn't appeared in Michigan since an infected white-tailed deer was detected in 2008 at a breeding farm in Kent County. This is the first time it has been found in Michigan's free-ranging deer population.
A sick animal was observed last month wandering around a Haslett residence and showing signs of illness, according to Michigan's DNR in a press release . The homeowner reported it and the deer was collected by a DNR wildlife biologist and delivered for initial testing to the DNR Wildlife Disease Laboratory at the Michigan State University Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health in Lansing.
The positive samples were then sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, for final confirmation.
"To date, there is no evidence that chronic wasting disease presents any risk to non-cervids, including humans, either through contact with an infected animal or from handling contaminated venison," the Michigan DNR said in the release. "However, as a precaution, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization recommend that infected animals not be consumed as food by either humans or domestic animals."
DNR director Keith Creagh said in the release: "The good news is that we are armed with a thoughtfully crafted response plan. We are using every available resource, to determine the extent of this disease, respond appropriately to limit further transmission, and ultimately eradicate the disease in Michigan if possible."
Officials said the state has tested about 34,000 wild deer since 1998 and found no evidence of the disease. About 21,000 samples from privately owned deer populations have been tested for the disease and all were negative in the state except for the western Michigan case.
Unlimited antlerless deer hunting licenses will be available this fall in a core CWD Area consisting of Alaiedon, Delhi, Lansing, Meridian, Wheatfield and Williamstown townships in Ingham County; Bath and DeWitt townships in Clinton County; and Woodhull Township in Shiawassee County.
Mandatory checking of deer will be required in this area during hunting seasons and restrictions of carcasses and parts of deer taken in the area will apply. A feeding and baiting ban is in immediate effect.
The DNR asks help from the public and hunters in reporting deer that are unusually thin or demonstrating unusual behavior such as a lack of fear of humans.
To report road-kills found in the Core CWD Area call the Wildlife Disease Hotline at 517-614-9602 during office hours. Leave a voicemail with location information.
