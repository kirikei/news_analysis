In his first trip to New Hampshire since announcing he’s running for president, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul stressed that it would take “the help of liberty lovers everywhere” for him to win.
The Kentucky Republican, first elected to the Senate in 2010, embraced his role as an outsider, taking on Democrats alongside Republicans he perceives as “part of the Washington machine.”
“The Washington machine that gobbles up our freedoms and invades every nook and cranny of our lives must be stopped,” he said.
He said he’s running for president because he sees opportunity and hope slipping away and debt piling up, a factor that hurts the economy and national security, he said.
“Both parties and the entire political system is to blame. Big government and debt doubled under Republicans, and now it has tripled under Barack Obama’s watch,” he said.
A riled-up crowd packed Milford Town Hall to capacity yesterday to hear Paul speak a day after he announced his campaign. It took only a minute for a “President Paul” chant to break out.
In line with his campaign motto – “Defeat the Washington machine, unleash the American dream” – Paul called for term limits in Congress and a constitutional amendment that requires Congress to pass a balanced budget.
He said the government should stop snooping on Americans’ phone records: “The phone records of law-abiding citizens are none of (the government’s) damn business.”
He said it should stop nation-building: “Conservatives should not succumb to the notion that government inept at home will somehow succeed at building nations abroad.”
And he said the country needed school choice, not Common Core, and should “repeal any law, like some of our drug laws, that disproportionately incarcerate people of color.”
Paul invoked the state’s motto, “Live Free or Die,” at the beginning of his speech, saying “when the founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto . . . they didn’t leave a lot of wiggle room.” Gen. John Stark, who penned the phrase, didn’t do so until well after the state was founded.
“They admonished you to live free. A government that takes half your pay does not leave you free. A government that sifts through your personal records does not leave you free,” he said.
On records collections, he said, “The president created this vast dragnet by executive order. As president, on Day One, I will immediately end” it.
Cities like Detroit, Paul said, would be better off with lower taxes than stimulus packages that have “widened the income gap” and benefited “politically connected cronies.”
Paul said he was born into an “America of prosperity,” but “my trips to Detroit and Appalachia and Chicago have revealed what I call an undercurrent of unease.”
“To restore America, one thing is for certain, we need to boldly proclaim our vision for America. We need to go boldly forth under a banner that clutches the Constitution in one hand and the Bill of Rights in the other,” he said.
Paul stated unequivocally that radical Islam is America’s enemy, calling radicals “haters of mankind.” He said national defense needed to be strong enough to defend attacks and deter enemies, but that it would be stronger if “unencumbered by overseas nation building.”
“We must realize that we do not project strength by borrowing money from China to send into Pakistan,” he said. “Let’s quit building bridges over there and build bridges over here.”
Paul was introduced and endorsed by state Sens. Kevin Avard and Andy Sanborn and state Rep. Victoria Sullivan. Sanborn touted Paul’s background not as a lifelong politician and said he could help fix “a broken Washington, D.C., where I can’t tell one party from another.” He also stressed the “huge responsibility” of holding the first-in-the-nation primary.
“We’re going to dictate the tone of how America’s going to be governed. We should take that responsibility seriously,” he said.
Bill Domenica brought with him to the event a sign that said “Freedom, too big to fail.” It was signed in 2012 by Paul’s father, Ron Paul, when he announced his intention to seek the Republican Party nomination for president. Yesterday, the same sign got Rand’s signature.
Domenica said he doesn’t trust any other potential candidate: “They’re all liars, to the core. None of them are going to do what they say.” Paul is different, he said, because he’s “not a career politician.”
“In my opinion, he’s the only candidate that’s going to give more liberty and less government. That’s the only thing that matters to me,” he said.
