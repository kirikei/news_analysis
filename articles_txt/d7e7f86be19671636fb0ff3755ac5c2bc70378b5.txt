CARSON CITY, Nev.
A Nevada legislative committee has passed a bill that would allow students to use the state funds designated for their public education at a private school.
The Senate Finance Committee voted Tuesday to approve an amended version of SB302, which would create education savings accounts. It's sponsored by Republican Sen. Scott Hammond.
The bill would allow students a grant equal to 90 percent of their per-pupil state funding allotment, which is a little more than $5,000 a year.
Students could use the state money deposited in the education savings account for tuition, textbooks or tutoring, but not college savings as previously proposed.
Democratic senators Joyce Woodhouse and David Parks opposed the measure.
The bill is similar to a bill signed by Gov. Brian Sandoval that would create so-called "Opportunity Scholarships."
