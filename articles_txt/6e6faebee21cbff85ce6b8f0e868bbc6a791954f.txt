BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) — Former Bridgeport Mayor Tom Bucci is supporting state legislation that would ban politicians convicted of corruption or other crimes from again seeking public office.
He joins Mayor Bill Finch who also backs the legislation.
The Connecticut Post reports ( http://bit.ly/1aB9L1F ) that Bucci said in a letter to the state legislature's Judiciary Committee that Bridgeport was set back more than a decade because of avarice.
Former Mayor Joseph Ganim served seven years in prison after being convicted of steering city contracts in exchange for wine, clothes, cash and home improvements.
Ganim is considering a campaign this year to take back his old job.
Finch is expected to seek re-election this fall.
