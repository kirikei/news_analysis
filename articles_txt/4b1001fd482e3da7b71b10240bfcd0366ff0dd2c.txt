Starting Wednesday morning (May 27) at 9 A.M. (EST)/ 6 A.M. (PST).T-Mobile’s  LG G4 will be available for early online pre orders.
Those who pre order will have their devices by June 3rd.
Pre orders can be placed with no money down and 24 monthly payments of $24.99 on an EIP (Equipment Installment Plan), which means you pay the full retail price of  $599.76.
While that sounds like a lot, many consider it a bargain based on previews of the highly-advanced smartphone-especially if you get it with T-Mobile’s exclusive leather-backed option.
In addition, T-Mobile is also offering an exclusive free memory upgrade promo for anyone who buys the LG G4  between May 27 (Wednesday)-June 21st.
The promotion gives customers a 128 GB Micro SD memory card for their G4; the offer must be redeemed by July 7th and can take up to 6 weeks to arrive.
LG is also running another promotion, where anyone who buys the phone before June 21st will receive a 32 GB memory card, extra removable battery, and battery charging cradle- all for free as well.
To redeem this promotion you can go to  http://www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/g4/battery .
Last, but not least, you can also have a chance to win a device and meet the team behind the LG G4 by catching The Preview bus.
The bus is in New York City today, San Francisco on May 28-29, Philadelphia on May 29-30 and  back home in Seattle on June 2-3.
