AUSTIN - The state House on Wednesday approved a $130 million early childhood education proposal that would encourage the creation of high-quality pre-kindergarten programs in Texas.
House Bill 4 is sponsored by Dan Huberty , R-Houston, and has the strong backing of Gov. Greg Abbott , who named high-quality pre-K as one of his five emergency items this session.
Currently, the state funds half-day public preschool for 4-year-olds from educationally disadvantaged, non-English speaking and military families. HB4 would funnel additional state money to those pre-K programs that meet new quality standards such as those that require additional teacher training, data reporting and parental involvement.
On Wednesday, several amendments were adopted to expand accreditation options for teachers, bar standardized testing of students in these programs and ensure Common Core - a set of K-12 math and English standards adopted by most other states but illegal in Texas - does not eek its way into pre-K classrooms.
After around four and a half hours of sometimes heated debate, the House approved the bill by a vote of 129-18.
