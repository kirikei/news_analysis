MADISON, Wis. — Madison's mayor builds on his legacy with an easy re-election.
Paul Soglin won another four-year term with about 72 percent of the vote in Tuesday's election. Soglin's challenger, Alderman Scott Resnick, was running in his first citywide campaign.
The 69-year-old Soglin has been mayor of Madison for 18 years, including stints in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
The State Journal (http://bit.ly/1Cwwnpv ) says Soglin campaigned on fiscal responsibility and addressing challenges of racial equality and poverty.
