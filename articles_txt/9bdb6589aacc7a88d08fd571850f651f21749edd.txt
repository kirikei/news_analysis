SEARCY, Ark. â€” The wife of an Arkansas judge who was seriously injured by a zebra said he is still recovering from the attack and that the animal will be studied.
Shannon Derrick told The Daily Citizen her husband Mark Derrick has been released from the hospital but both of his arms need surgical repair. The White County District Court judge was attacked March 15 at his father's property in Searcy as he was collecting manure for a garden.
The animal bit him on both arms and injured his eye.
"He's been released from the hospital, but he'll be returning for his ninth surgery, for his arms," said Shannon Derrick. "They may be doing some skin grafting."
She said Little Rock Zoo officials and state veterinarians have taken oral swabs from the zebra to help determine what caused the attack.
"They want to study the zebra, because this kind of attack doesn't ever happen around here (in Arkansas)," Shannon Derrick said. "We haven't heard the results of that swab yet, but it will be interesting to hear."
Shannon Derrick said her father-in-law plans to sell the zebra at an auction in Missouri.
White County District Court-Beebe Court Clerk Misty Perkins said cases presided over by Mark Derrick in March have been rescheduled in April.
Shannon Derrick said her husband is in good spirits and is ready to go back to work.
"He's not physically ready, but mentally he's ready to go back," she said. "He's already wanting to stop and sign some forms at the office before we head back to the hospital.
