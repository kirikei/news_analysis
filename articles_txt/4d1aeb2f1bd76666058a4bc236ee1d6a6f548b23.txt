CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - Nevada senators have passed a proposal increasing the state's minimum wage and modifying how overtime hours are calculated.
Senators voted 11-9 on party lines to approve SB193 on Friday. The bill now moves to the Assembly.
The bill raises minimum wage for employees without employer-offered health insurance to $9 an hour and removes several rules governing how overtime is calculated.
Democrats opposed the bill saying it wouldn't change the $7.25 wage for workers with employer-provided health care and that it wouldn't fairly compensate workers with longer shifts.
Republicans rejected four Democrat-sponsored amendments increasing the proposed wage bump and modifying the overtime calculations.
