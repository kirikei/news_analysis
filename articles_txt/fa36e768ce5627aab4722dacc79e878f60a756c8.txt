A seemingly unlikely friendship between New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Dallas Cowboysâ owner Jerry Jones has been the butt of many jokes, but has now evolved into the subject of scrutiny from federal prosecutors.
An investigation is underway around how Legends Hospitality LLC, which is co-owned by Jones, secured the rights to operate the One World Trade Centerâs observation deck. The nationâs tallest building is controlled by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is controlled by â you guessed it â Christie and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo .
Under the agreement, Legends operates the deck on floors 100, 101 and 102 of the building. It also includes a public space on the 100th floor, a restaurant on the 101st floor and event space on the 102nd and 104th floors.
Christie has said he did not strike up a friendship with Jones until September 2013, six months after the observation deckâs contract was awarded, ESPN said .
He has called those who questioned his involvement âpartisan hacksâ and âaluminum-foil-on-their-head conspiracy theorists.â
But it is not the first time Christie has been accused of misusing his public office.
In September 2013âs âbridge scandal,â he was accused of ordering lane closures near the George Washington Bridge after mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, did not endorse him for re-election. At the time, Christie called the allegations âinexplicably stupid.â
