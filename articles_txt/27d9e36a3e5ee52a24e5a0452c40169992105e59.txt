BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Republican Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter has signed legislation that will ban Idaho women from receiving abortion-inducing drugs via telemedicine.
The new law signed on Monday requires a doctor to be physically present when giving pregnancy-ending pills. But telemedicine is not even currently available in the state.
The law also requires doctors to make efforts to schedule a follow-up visit with the woman after administering the drugs.
Proponents argue the law protects women from potential complications. But opponents say using telemedicine does not lower the standard of care by physicians.
The bill passed both chambers on party line votes.
The Guttmacher Institute , a research center that supports abortion rights, says 16 other states currently have similar laws.
