Here’s a light — and supremely childish — moment from Chicago’s mayoral election: two women on opposing sides of the race silently jostling at a press conference for Jesus “Chuy” Garcia.
In a video recorded Friday outside Darwin Elementary School and posted to YouTube on Sunday, a blonde woman’s attempts to film Garcia with a camcorder are blocked by a Garcia supporter, who mirrors her every move and uses a Garcia campaign sign to obstruct the blonde woman’s view. A description attached to the video describes the blonde woman as a tracker for Emanuel — a campaign worker who watches and reports what the opposition is doing.

Garcia was present at the event, and some of those who attended could be seen snickering at the two women.
“Yeah, we are not going to comment on this one,” a spokesperson for Emanuel’s camp said. Garcia’s campaign also declined to comment.
