Serena Williams is still being troubled by her elbow injury despite a straight-sets win over Andrea Hlavackova at the French Open.
The world number one withdrew in Rome due to the injury but it mattered little on Tuesday as the crushed Czech Republic's Hlavackova 6-2 6-3 at Roland Garros.
But Williams said it was still affecting her game, particularly her serve – having only sent down five aces.
"I was really happy to see how my elbow was going to do," the 19-time grand slam champion said.
"It's not 100 per cent but I was able to serve OK, I didn't serve as many aces as I usually do.
"I think it gets better every day, so another day off tomorrow and then hopefully if I can win another round it will be better."
Williams, who faces German Anna-Lena Friedsam in the second round, also took time during her media conference to praise Andy Murray.
The 33-year-old lauded the Brit for his support of the women's game, even suggesting he made her feel bad.
"I mean obviously Andy Murray goes out of his way, is so positive with women players and doesn't play favourites," Williams said.
"He is always watching women's tennis - he watches more than I do and makes me feel bad. So I think that is inspiring.
"And also he really is pro-women, he goes all out for [coach] Amelie Mauresmo, hiring her I thought was really awesome."
