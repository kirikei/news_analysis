Democrats renew call for changes to Gov. Scott Walker’s budget
Wisconsin State Capitol
MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Democrats are renewing their call for significant changes to Gov. Scott Walker’s budget proposal, including reducing a $300 million cut to the University of Wisconsin System and spending more money on public schools.
The four Democrats on the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee sent a letter Wednesday to the Republican co-chairs of the committee asking for a series of changes in light of comments from the public in reaction to Walker’s plan.
The Democrats are calling for removal of a proposed cut to the SeniorCare program as well as changes to the structure of the state’s long-term care system for the elderly and disabled.
Republicans have signaled that SeniorCare will be protected and cuts Walker proposed to public schools and UW will be reduced, especially if tax collection projections improve.
