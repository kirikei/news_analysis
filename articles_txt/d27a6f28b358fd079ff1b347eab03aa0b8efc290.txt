The Secret Service had a recent mishap behind the wheel at the White House, but that hasn’t stopped the agency from teaching President Obama’s oldest daughter how to drive, The New York Daily News reports. 
“The Secret Service (taught her) actually, because they wouldn’t let me in the car with her,” the First Lady told television host Rachel Ray in an interview airing Thursday.
To get a true sense of the road, 16-year-old Malia has driven outside White House grounds, but never without security.
The president said the driving lessons give Malia “a sense of normalcy.”
“My kids have got to learn how to live in the world like normal kids,” Obama said.
