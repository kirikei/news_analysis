BALTIMORE (AP) — Buddy Roogow, the director of the D.C. Lottery and a former official in Maryland, has died after suffering an aneurysm. He was 65.
District of Columbia Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey DeWitt announced Roogow’s death. He died Saturday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. DeWitt called Roogow a “consummate professional” known for his warmth, enthusiasm, energy and humor.
Roogow spent most of his career working in government. He has led the D.C. Lottery since 2009. Previously he served as director of the Maryland Lottery since 1996.
Prior to his work in state lotteries, Roogow served as deputy chief of staff for Maryland Gov. William Donald  Schaefer and Gov. Parris Glendening. He also served as county administrative officer in Howard County.
A funeral service is planned for Tuesday in Ellicott City.
