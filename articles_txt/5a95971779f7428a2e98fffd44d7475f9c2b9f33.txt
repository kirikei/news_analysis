San Francisco â€” California Highway Patrol officials released audio from the 911 call that led to the arrest of former 49ers and Bears defensive end Ray McDonald.
KRON-TV reported Tuesday a woman, mother of the alleged victim, says McDonald was drunk when she called authorities before dawn Monday.
McDonald was later arrested at a San Jose home on suspicion of assaulting a woman who was holding the couple's baby. McDonald was released on bail, facing misdemeanor charges of domestic violence and child endangerment
The caller says she wasn't at the home but that her daughter told her to call police, according to the audio.
Later in the day the Bears released McDonald.
The arrest follows a pattern of similar incidents.
McDonald's agent Tom Condon has not returned multiple calls seeking comment.
Suh at Dolphins OTAs
Dolphins attendance is on the rise. Ndamukong Suh showed up for practice Tuesday.
The $114 million defensive tackle, signed from the Lions as a free agent, drew attention for his absence from offseason training sessions in recent weeks, but was on the field with the rest of his new teammates for the Dolphins first organized team activity.
Like the training sessions, attending OTAs is voluntary but strongly encouraged by coaches. Taking part was an easy decision, Suh said.
"It's automatic," he said. "You never miss practice. I don't miss practice."
Suh declined to discuss why he skipped the training sessions.
"Next question," he said.
Suh rarely attended OTAs when he was with the Lions.

Sam greets Montreal
Michael Sam says his only priority is helping the Montreal Alouettes win, not by making history as the first openly gay football player in the Canadian Football League.
Sam signed a two-year deal with the Alouettes last week.
"I'm not trying to really do anything historic here by being with Montreal, I'm just trying to help the team win some games so we can bring the Grey Cup back home," Sam said at a packed news conference.
Sam, 25, came out publicly before last year's NFL draft. He was selected in the seventh round by the Rams to become the first openly gay player chosen by an NFL team. The Rams cut him in training camp.
