She's the youngest person to ever be named in Forbes “Powerful Women” list.
Another day, another record set by Taylor Swift.
The 25-year-old singer has become the youngest woman to be included on the Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.
And it’s not just her ability to rope in 18 A-listers into her “Bad Blood” music video for which she’s receiving accolades for.
Estimating her earnings to be somewhere around the $81 million mark, the yearly roundup has her at number 64 because: "The bona fide, cross-genre global megastar has not only broken record sales and captivated the world with her fantastically honest music, but she has proven herself as an impressive businesswoman."
And she’s in incredible company.
The list released on Tuesday gave German Chancellor Angela Merkel number one spot, followed by Hilary Clinton. Michelle Obama rounded out the 10th spot.
As for Taylor’s fellow peers in the entertainment biz, these included Oprah Winfrey at 12, Beyonce at 21 and Angelina Jolie at number 54.
