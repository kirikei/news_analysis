MILWAUKEE — Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says he prefers Gov. Scott Walker's financing plan for a new Bucks stadium over a proposal from a Wisconsin lawmaker that would involve tapping the state public lands board for a loan.
Barrett said at a news conference Thursday he supports the governor's plan that involves selling $220 million in state bonds. But Walker in an interview on WTMJ-AM called his own financing plan dead.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald recently proposed a $150 million loan for the project from the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and WITI-TV report Barrett also outlined the city's expected contribution, saying Milwaukee would provide $17 million in infrastructure improvements, a parking ramp and a parcel of land.
Barrett says the city and county combined can contribute $50 million.
