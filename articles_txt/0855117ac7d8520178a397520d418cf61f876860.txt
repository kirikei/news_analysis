INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (April 5, 2015) — The men’s Final Four is already one for the record books in Indianapolis. While the exact numbers aren’t known, the economic forecast looks like it’ll beat the old record set in 2010. This is the seventh time Indy has been the host city for the men’s Final Four.
“Indiana’s a nice place, we’re checking it all out,” said Leslie Hall of Hazard, KY.
Hall is feeling a little down since her team didn’t win, but she’s staying in Indy until the end.
“We’ll cheer on the Badgers, they have a great team,” Hall said.
Some of the hotels have seen Kentucky Wildcats fans leave. The ones staying are continuing to spend money, helping reach that record level. Anyone leaving will just be replaced by fans from a different team.
“Fans who no longer want their tickets, say their team loses like UK or Michigan State, those get officially put on the exchange, fair market value, put in to the hands of other fans,” said Chris Gahl with Visit Indy.
Gahl also says we’ll probably just see more Wisconsin Badgers fans. It’s estimated 70,000 people will spend almost $71 million. That’s compared to $55 million spent by 60,000 people for the Final Four in 2010. Gahl loves that.
“Came at a great time, as we were still under crisis mode with the RFRA and some of the negative backlash and perception problems that the city was facing,” he added.
It also helps the fact that three of the four teams are on either end of Indiana which makes for an easy drive to get here and stay here. Officials will meet with the NCAA on Tuesday to go over attendance numbers, ticket sales and hotel rooms consumed to get a good look at the economic impact.
