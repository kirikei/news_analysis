AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — After a week's delay, state senators are set to begin considering a contentious plan to repeal a Texas law granting in-state public university tuition to the children of some people in the United States illegally.
Democrats and Hispanic advocacy groups champion the law, while Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature have pledged to end it.
On Monday, the two sides finally begin clashing. Last week's committee hearing on the issue was canceled.
The bipartisan tuition law sailed through the Legislature in 2001 and received Republican Gov. Rick Perry 's signature. But many of the modern Texas GOP's top leaders were elected promising to advance harder-line immigration positions.
Though divisive, the repeal should eventually clear committee and get full Senate approval. Its chances in the House could be far murkier, however.
