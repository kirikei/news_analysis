A new Ontario law will see electronic cigarettes treated in the same manner as traditional cigarettes.
E-cigarettes cannot be sold to anyone under 19, banned in smoke free areas, and promotions and displays being regulated.
Ontario’s associate health minister Dipika Damerla says it’s an “emerging technology” with no evidence it helps break a smokers addiction.
However, should Health Canada gives it stamp of approval as a stop smoking option, the law could be changed.
