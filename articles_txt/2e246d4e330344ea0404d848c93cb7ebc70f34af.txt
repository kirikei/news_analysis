For placing the pre-order customers don't need to pay any money down. Instead they can opt  24 monthly payments of $24.99 on an EIP (Equipment Installment Plan), which means it's going to cost full retail price of $599.76.

Beside T-Mobile, LG is running another promotion, where anyone who buys the phone before June 21st will receive a 32 GB memory card, extra removable battery, and battery charging cradle- all for free as well. The offer can be redeemed here .
