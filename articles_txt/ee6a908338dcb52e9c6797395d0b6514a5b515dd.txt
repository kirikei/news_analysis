The irony of Cheney’s latest anti-Obama broadside

That said, the failed former vice president has become a little more unhinged than usual lately, and this morning he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that the president is “about to give [Iran] nuclear weapons.”
“I vacillate between the various theories I’ve heard, but you know, if you had somebody as president who wanted to take America down, who wanted to fundamentally weaken our position in the world and reduce our capacity to influence events, turn our back on our allies and encourage our adversaries, it would look exactly like what Barack Obama’s doing,” Cheney said when asked whether he thought the president is naive or something else.
 
 
 
 
From Cheney’s perspective, Obama’s not naive. Rather, Cheney suggests that Obama actually wants Iran to have nuclear weapons, despite the fact that Obama has taken so many steps to prevent Iran from having nuclear weapons. But as Jon Chait noted , this leads to some awkward questions for the Republican leader himself.
 
What’s more, the expansion of Iran’s power under Bush was not limited to the blossoming if its nuclear program. In 2003, an extremely hostile neighboring regime (that had launched a war against it two decades before) was deposed, creating a power vacuum that Iran filled. Cheney seems to have played a role there. A Cheney-style analysis of the Bush administration’s Iran policy would conclude that it was carrying out a deliberate plan to elevate Iran’s standing.
