Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick and Sen. John McCain
U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick will have an uphill battle against longtime incumbent Sen. John McCain when she runs for his Senate seat in 2016.
With more than $3 million already raised, McCain is going for a sixth term in the U.S. Senate. Enter Kirkpatrick, who narrowly won the race for Arizona’s 1st Congressional District in 2014. She is billing herself as a moderate Democrat in touch with the evolving demographics and politics of Arizona.
In her official announcement video, Kirkpatrick said she respects "John McCain's service to our nation. I just believe our state is changing.” 
Arizona State University political scientist Kim Fridkin called Kirkpatrick's run against McCain "a long shot."
While 90 percent of Senate races are won by the incumbent, Fridkin believes a strategy for Kirkpatrick could be to emphasize McCain’s longevity.
“He has been in office for a long time. He is older, and he is being challenged by the right," Fridken said. "So all those things could add up to some leverage for Kirkpatrick.”
Kirkpatrick is currently serving her third term in the U.S. House of Representatives.
