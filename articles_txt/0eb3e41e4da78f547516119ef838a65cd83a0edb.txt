DETROIT (AP) - A federal judge says parts of Michigan's sex offender registry law are unconstitutional, including a requirement that offenders stay at least 1,000 feet from schools.
The Detroit Free Press reports that U.S. District Judge Robert Cleland struck down several reporting requirements of the 1994 law, which has been amended several times by state lawmakers to make requirements stricter.
Cleland says offenders must guess about school safety zones and aren't provided with enough information to follow the law. Cleland also struck down a mandate that offenders report new email and instant messaging addresses in person and notify authorities of all telephone numbers they routinely use.
The state and law enforcement officials are reviewing the ruling. The lawsuit was filed in 2012 by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan.
