SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner wants to repeal a law passed last fall that cut the size of juries in civil cases from 12 to six but also increased juror pay.
Jurors currently are paid between $4 and $10 a day. Starting June 1, they would receive $25 for the first day and $50 for each additional day.
The Republican governor says that would put added budget pressure on some counties and that repealing the law would save taxpayer dollars.
The measure was backed by trial lawyers. Illinois Trial Lawyers Association President John Cooney says the pay increase would reduce the hardship for some who miss work days.
McHenry County Court Administrator James Wallis says the pay bump would more than double what the county paid for juries last year.
