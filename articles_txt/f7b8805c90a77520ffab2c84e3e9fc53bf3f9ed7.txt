SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) â€” Performers who entertain the crowds that pack downtown Saratoga Springs in the summer would have to obtain licenses under a proposal being considered by the city's leaders.
Musicians and artists were among the speakers who showed up at a public hearing Tuesday at city hall to voice opposition to the proposed law, which would require street performers to be licensed and follow new guidelines on where they could set up and when they could perform.
A tradition for decades during the warm-weather months, buskers perform outside the shops and restaurants that line Saratoga's Broadway, the city's main thoroughfare. Most play for tips.
Sixteen-year-old Sawyer Fredericks, a contestant this week on NBC's "The Voice," has done some busking on Broadway. The teen is from the town Glen in the Mohawk Valley.
