ROCKETS CENTER Dwight Howard was one of several hundred stranded at the Toyota Center after Game 4 of the Western Conference finals on Monday night due to flash flooding in Houston.
But instead of lamenting his fate, he went back onto the arena floor and mingled with the fans.
Howard, signed autographs and posed for pictures while waiting out the harsh weather. His mom and young son - who played catch with fans - were also there.
"I can't go nowhere, so I'm with the fans," Howard told KPRC News.

The Rockets had defeated Golden State, 128-115, to avoid being swept. Game 5 is tonight in Oakland.
As the end of the game neared, a message was posted on the scoreboard advising fans to stay in the building until the severe weather passed. Between 6 and 10 inches of rain fell Monday, causing flooding throughout the Houston area.
Howard reportedly stayed in the arena until 1:30 a.m. Some fans stayed much later.
"Sleepy . . . crazy . . . but fine," he said of the ordeal. "I think if we would have lost, everybody in this arena would be trying to find a way to get out of here despite the flood. We got a good win and it just stinks that all these people can't get home and get to their families and their loved ones."
