NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) – Gov. Bill Haslam will travel across the state this week to highlight an initiative for adults to attend a Tennessee college of applied technology free of tuition and fees.
Tennessee Reconnect is a last-dollar scholarship program that was part of Haslam’s Tennessee Promise legislation passed last year.
It also ties in with Haslam’s “Drive to 55″ campaign to improve the state’s graduation rates from the current 32 percent to 55 percent by 2025 in order to help improve overall job qualifications and attract employers to the state.
There are 27 colleges of applied technology in the state.
The Republican governor is scheduled to attend an event at TCAT Nashville on Monday before traveling to Jackson and Memphis on Thursday, and Chattanooga and Knoxville on Friday.
