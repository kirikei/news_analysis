Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., listens to the national anthem during a groundbreaking ceremony for the Interstate 11 Boulder City bypass project Monday, April 6, 2015, in Boulder City, Nev.
LAS VEGAS (AP) — U.S. Sen. Harry Reid has a new chief of staff for the remainder of his term.
The Senate's Democratic minority leader announced Thursday that former Senate Sergeant at Arms Drew Willison has replaced David Krone .
Krone has been Reid's chief of staff since 2011 and deputy chief of staff before that.
In a statement Reid likens Krone to family and credits him for his "wise counsel and strategic insight."
The announcement doesn't mention what Krone will do next. Krone says in an email he has no plans.
Reid announced last month that he would not seek re-election in 2016.
Reid has been recovering from injuries he said he suffered New Year's Day in his Henderson home when an exercise band snapped, hitting him.
