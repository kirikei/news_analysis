Mayoral candidate Lynne Abraham collapsed on stage at the first debate Tuesday night. 
The moderator was told at 7:40 p.m. that the former district attorney was doing well, but still "resting."
Abraham quickly regained consciousness and was helped off stage just after 7 p.m.. The debate, aired on NBC10, went to commercial and then resumed without Abraham.
An usher said Abraham seemed to be recovering and may have succumbed to the heat of the stage lights. 
 
 
"Is there a doctor in the house?" says debate moderator @jimrosenfield #NextMayorPHL @LynneForMayor audibly says she's ok. @NewsWorksWHYY
