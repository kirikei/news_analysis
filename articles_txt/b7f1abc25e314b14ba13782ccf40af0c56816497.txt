Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander sharp in simulated game, on track to begin rehab assignment early next week
Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander optimistic after simulated game: 'I felt really good' Detroit Tigers starting pitcher Justin Verlander struck out nine batters and threw 4 1/3 shutout innings in a highly anticipated simulated game Tuesday in Oakland.
OAKLAND -- The Detroit Tigers were shut out again Tuesday. And that's a good thing.
Justin Verlander took a big step towards rejoining the Tigers when he struck out nine Tigers -- who served as batters -- and tossed 4 1/3 shutout innings in his first simulated game since mid-April.
He was only scheduled to pitch four innings, but successfully lobbied to face one more batter after the fourth inning and capped his strong outing with a four-pitch strikeout.
"It went really well," said Verlander, who has been sidelined since March 29 with a triceps strain. "But first and foremost, the most important thing, I felt really good."
It marked the first simulated game for Verlander since he had a simulated game cut short in Pittsburgh on April 15 after feeling soreness in his throwing arm.
This time, Verlander reported no discomfort or fatigue.
"It was very encouraging," Verlander said. "I had no problem getting loose. It felt really, and it was also really encouraging."
The Tigers will wait until Wednesday to see how Verlander's arm responds to the simulated game. If the 32-year-old starting pitcher reports no discomfort, there's a strong chance he'll begin a rehab assignment early next week.
"I'm actually not anxious," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. "I think he's going to be fine, quite frankly. But me thinking that doesn't mean he will be."
It's unclear where Verlander would be assigned or how many rehab appearances he'd need to make before rejoining the Tigers. However, he may require only one or two starts in order to rebuild the arm strength needed to throw around 100 pitches.
Verlander threw 70 pitches Tuesday -- including a mix of sliders, curveballs and changeups -- and gave up just three hits, all singles. He said he wasn't the least bit hesitant to throw his curveball -- the pitch he threw March 27 when he initially felt his arm tighten up in a Grapefruit League start against the Toronto Blue Jays.
"I thought he looked really good," Ausmus said. "The hitters thought he looked good and (Tigers pitching coach Jeff Jones) thought he looked good."
With bullpen catcher Jeff Kunkel serving as both catcher and plate umpire, Verlander struck out the side in the third inning, getting Bryan Holaday and Tyler Collins to watch called third strikes before Hernan Perez whiffed at a third strike.
The stadium's radar gun at O.co Coliseum wasn't turned on during the simulated game, but Ausmus said he was impressed with the finish on Verlander's fastball.
"And the break on his breaking balls -- they both looked really good," Ausmus said. "Better than I thought they were be for where he's at."
Known for being a creature of habit, Verlander mimicked his routine during regular starts, going as far as simulating the national anthem before he took the mound. Following each inning pitched, he'd sit in the Tigers' dugout for five or six minutes.
In an effort to better replicate the atmosphere of a regular season game, several Tigers players watched his outing from seats and attempted to do the wave. Tigers reliever Joba Chamberlain went as far as playing the role of a concession stand vendor in the stands, selling imaginary hot dogs and beer between innings. 
"We treated it about as real as you can," Verlander said. "The guys in the stands tried to get the wave going, but the fans weren't very receptive to it. It was great."
