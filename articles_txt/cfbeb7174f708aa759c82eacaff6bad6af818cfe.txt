Lynne Abraham collapses at debate, says she is “100 percent OK”
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A former Philadelphia district attorney running for mayor is resting after she collapsed at a televised debate.
A campaign spokesman for Lynne Abraham says she fainted during the Tuesday debate at the city's Kimmel Center.
Spokesman Sam Coleman says the 74-year-old Abraham was evaluated and is "100 percent OK."
Abraham is one of six Democrats running to replace two-term Mayor Michael Nutter.
She fell as state Sen. Anthony Williams was speaking about school funding. The thud stunned the audience.
NBC 10 quickly cut to commercial, and Abraham did not return when the debate resumed.
NBC 10 anchor and debate moderator Jim Rosenfield said the candidates' thoughts were with Abraham.
