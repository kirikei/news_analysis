Abraham Lincoln was shot by an assassin on Good Friday and died early on Holy Saturday, April 15, 1865. The next day, Easter Sunday, Allegheny County residents filled churches as their pastors sought to provide some comfort and understanding following the first murder of a United States president.
Lincoln was born poor and arrived at middle age “unknown, save to a limited circle of political friends,” the Rev. E.B. Snyder said in his sermon that Easter Sunday at Christ Methodist Episcopal Church. His church was on what is now Pittsburgh’s North Side.
“So little was Mr. Lincoln known to fame, so untried and inexperienced was he in civil affairs ... that many of the best and wisest men of the land felt that committing the reins of the government into his hands was, at best, but an experiment,” he said.
“But Mr. Lincoln was a child of Providence,” the pastor told his flock, according to a Daily Pittsburgh Gazette story that appeared April 17, 1865. “God saw that he was the right man for the right place at the right time.”
While men die, the nation lives. “As in the church, God takes away the workman but the work goes on,” Rev. Snyder said.
Thanks to the telegraph, news of the president’s shooting had reached Pittsburgh shortly after the initially unnamed assassin’s attack. The Daily Pittsburgh Gazette on Saturday had a fairly complete first-day front-page story about both the fatal attack on Lincoln and the stabbing of William Seward, the secretary of state, at his home that night. Journalism is a rough draft of history, and the biggest error that morning was an all-capital-letters subhead in the Gazette that predicted “THE SECRETARY WILL PROBABLY DIE.”
Many more mistakes were to come as the search for the president’s assassin intensified, and newspapers — including the Gazette — too often reported rumors and hearsay.
Lincoln died early Saturday. By Monday, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor, had been identified as the assassin — although his last name was being spelled Boothe in many of the initial stories. The suspect’s brother, the more famous Edwin Booth, was not a suspect. Edwin Booth “has been throughout a Union man,” the Gazette reported that day. “He has played on different occasions [in New York City] for the benefit of the Sanitary Commission, and in many other ways has shown his sympathy with the Union cause.”
That day’s paper also contained the news that “SEWARD WILL RECOVER” and an erroneous report picked up from the New York Herald: “Boothe has been arrested near Baltimore, and will be placed for safekeeping on board a monitor at the Navy Yard” in Washington. “Monitor” was both the name of the Navy’s first iron-clad warship and the name given to a class of small, heavily armed naval vessels.
It was a bad time to be a young man with dark wavy hair and a mustache.
On April 18 the Gazette reported that Booth had been arrested on a train traveling between Altoona and Greensburg by Provost Marshal John Cuthbertson. The marshal “compared the description given of Boothe … and found it to coincide in every particular,” the story said.
That story had to be corrected when it was determined that the suspect was instead an Iowa hotel owner named L. Emerson Davis. His arrest on the Greensburg-bound train marked the second time he had been mistaken for Booth, he told officials. He had been held earlier in Washington until he could prove his identity.
April 19 produced a story that “Boothe and the other conspirators, about thirty in number,” had clashed with Union cavalry in Maryland as they attempted to flee south.
During the next week Booth was spotted in locations across Pennsylvania, including Reading, Tamaqua, Catawissa and Port Clinton. The keeper of a whiskey shop in Brooklyn claimed to have seen the assassin, but that story “could not be traced to a reliable source,” the Gazette report on April 27.
The next day’s paper, April 28, brought the definitive news that Booth had been found on a farm in St. Mary’s County, Md. Trapped in a burning barn, the actor had refused to surrender. He was shot and fatally wounded.
As the nation went into mourning for the president, public events were called off. A classified notice in the Gazette on April 17 alerted residents that “The First Annual Ball of the Niagara Steam Fire Engine and Hose Company, which was to have taken place at Concert Hall this evening, has been postponed until further notice in consequence of the death of President Lincoln.”
The next day’s paper included a report on an outdoor meeting held Monday, April 17, outside the Post Office, at what is now Fifth Avenue and Smithfield Street, to decide on how the city should mark the president’s death.
The story described “spontaneous abandonment of the people of all their ordinary avocations and the closing of their places of business from Saturday morning until Monday night.” Those actions “indicate the universal regard and respect for the lamentable dead, and the deep gloom which pervades all hearts on account of the great national loss we deplore.”
Black crepe hanging on public buildings should remain for a month and any symbols of mourning on private homes should stay up until Lincoln’s funeral, according to the report. “Citizens generally are requested to wear an appropriate badge of mourning for thirty days,” the story advised.
Lincoln had passed through Allegheny City and Pittsburgh in February 1861 on the way to his inauguration in Washington. The initial expectation was that the funeral train carrying his body back to Springfield, Ill., would retrace that route in reverse, making stops in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and Philadelphia.
Whenever Lincoln’s body arrived here, Mayor James Lowry and a special committee were to “take the necessary measures for a general funeral escort by our entire population and for such other ceremonies as in their judgment may be appropriate to the said occasion.”
That final goodbye was not to be. When Secretary of War Edwin Stanton arranged the itinerary for Lincoln’s funeral train, he dropped both Pittsburgh and Cincinnati from the route in favor of a new stop in Chicago.
