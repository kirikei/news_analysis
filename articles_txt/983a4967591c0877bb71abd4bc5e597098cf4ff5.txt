Google may launch two Nexus smartphones made by Huawei, LG
Google might be planning on launching two new Nexus smartphones this year made by two different makers, namely Huawei and LG. Also, if rumours are to be believed, the company might not introduce a Nexus tablet. The devices are reportedly slated to launch in the traditional launch period which is during October.
Previously, there have been rumours flooding the internet on how Huawei will manufacture Google’s next smartphone but none have stated that LG would also be a part of process. According to a report by Android Police , the device manufactured by Huawei will be codenamed Bullhead and will sport a 5.7-inch display, while LG’s device is dubbed Angler and will feature a 5.2-inch display. The company’s flagship tablet Nexus 9, will continue to run for another cycle which implies that there will be no new addition to the tablet series, as of now.
The report also sheds some light on a few more specifications. LG’s Nexus phone is rumoured to have a 2700mAh battery along with a Snapdragon 810 processor. It could be changed before it’s official release. Coincidentally, it is the same hexa-core processor that powers the LG G4. Most likely, the LG Angler will be the the 2015 Nexus 5 which everyone has been begging for, points out Android Police.
On the other hand, Huawei’s Bullhead, which is a more hefty device, is said to have a 3500mAh battery and may use the Snapdragon 810 processor, which has been rumoured previously as well.
