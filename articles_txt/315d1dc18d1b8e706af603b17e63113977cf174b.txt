Tornado touchdowns in Tulsa and Cleveland Counties over the past two weeks caused residential and commercial damage. Governor Fallin announced today that a request for disaster assistance was denied by FEMA. Fallin said she was disappointed by the response but the state continues to work to being assistance to those affected by the storms.
Fallin announced that a request has for a disaster declaration has been submitted to the Small Business Administration. If approved, an SBA declaration would deliver SBA low-interest disaster loans for renters, homeowners and business owners for replacement and repairs not covered by insurance. More than 1000 homes and businesses were damaged on March 25th. There were four deaths and 26 people had to be hospitalized for storm-related injuries.
