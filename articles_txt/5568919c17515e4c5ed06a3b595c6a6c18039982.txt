SALT LAKE CITY, April 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack  Obama met with top leaders of the Mormon church shortly after  arriving in Utah on Thursday to discuss immigration reform and  other issues, his spokesman said.
Obama is spending the night in Utah, home of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, during a short domestic trip  to highlight economic issues that included an earlier stop in  Kentucky.
"The president is pleased to meet with top LDS leaders as so  many presidents before him have done," White House spokesman  Eric Schultz said in a statement.
"The leaders will discuss the need to forge more common  ground across differences and to promote service to our  neighbors, both in our own country and around the world."
This is Obama's first trip to Utah as U.S. president.
Church leaders who were at the meeting included President  Henry Eyring, President Dieter Uchtdorf, Elder Tom Perry and  Elder Todd Christofferson, the White House said.     (Reporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Paul Tait)
