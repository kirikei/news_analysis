Futch volunteered to attend what ended up being a small roundtable with the president and several Utah lawmakers on behalf of his employer, Vivant Solar, because the White House requested the attendance of a representative from the company with military experience. But he had no idea that he would end up sitting a seat away from the commander in chief in such an intimate environment.
Obama was visiting Utah to promote a program that seeks to use the solar energy industry to benefit military service members and veterans.
"If I had known it was my commander in chief, I definitely would have been wearing my [Air National Guard uniform]," Futch said. —Teresa Mull

John Langley's 40-year career as an adult-film actor is "nothing that I'm ashamed of in any way shape of form," the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) candidate tells the BBC's Paul Barltrop. Langley, who makes pornographic films under the stage name Johnny Rockard, is running for a city council position  in Bristol, England, and his populist, right-wing, anti-European Union, immigrant-wary party was aware of his past, and fine with it.
Not only is Langley proud of his porn career, he also thinks it is a political bonus — at least for some voters. "People who are UKIP voters, who like UKIP, like us because we are not the beige, bland, boring career politicians that they see," he told Barltrop. "You know, I have a life — people can see I have a life." Voters appreciate "dealing with real people," he added, "not people up there at the top of politics who are so far removed from them. They're dealing with ordinary people like myself." When Barltrop pressed the point, Langley shrugged off the fair point that porn stars aren't "real people." Watch British politics in action below. —Peter Weber
 
A news helicopter caught deputies arresting and then beating a man after a chase on horseback in Apple Valley, California.
Pursuit on horseback ends w/deputies stunning man with Taser, beating him, @TonyNBCLA reports. http://t.co/7hyrvFFHf7 pic.twitter.com/B1MpQ0B6zq
The strange pursuit began Thursday afternoon, when authorities say a search warrant was served at a home in the area. The suspect fled in a vehicle, ditched the car several miles away, and then stole a horse, injuring the animal as they rode through rugged terrain. When deputies caught up to the suspect — identified as Francis Jared Pusok, 30, of Apple Valley — he was thrown off the horse and hit with a Taser. Authorities say the Taser did not work because of his loose clothes, and a use of force occurred.
NBC Los Angeles' NewsChopper 4 was covering the chase, and was able to record the arrest and subsequent use of force as it happened. The station estimates that Pusok was kicked 17 times, punched 37 times, and hit with batons four times in the two minutes after he was hit with the Taser. The video does not appear to show Pusok receiving medical treatment, and he is now hospitalized with unknown injuries. Three deputies also received medical attention — two for dehydration, and one for injuries sustained after being kicked by the horse.
San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon has ordered an immediate internal investigation. "I can certainly understand the concerns in the community based on what they saw on the video," he told NBC Los Angeles . "I'm disturbed by what I see in the video. But I don't need to jump to conclusions at this point, until we do a complete and throughout investigation. If our deputy sheriffs did something wrong, they'll be put off work and they'll be dealt with appropriately, all in accordance with the law as well as our department policy."
Everyone has long expected former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to run for president again in 2016, but nobody knew when she was going to make it official. Well, according to the New York Daily News and The Guardian , Sunday's the day. Multiple Clinton sources wouldn't confirm the Sunday launch with Reuters  and The Wall Street Journal , but they did confirm that the big announcement is coming very soon.
Clinton would be the first Democrat in the race, and the strong favorite to win her party's nomination. Formally declaring her candidacy this early will let her start raising money — this is the start of the quarter, and she will have until the end of June to bring in donations before reporting her haul. She would also "have a full operation to help her not only define her policies but to ward off all these attacks that are coming from the right as well," Democratic strategist Jim Manley tells the Daily News .

If you're the type who scoffs at the size of a Big Gulp, you'll be pleased to know that on Saturday, 7-Elevens across the United States will let customers fill up almost any gigantic container they want with Slurpee during "Bring Your Own Cup Day."
7-Eleven rolls out BYO Slurpee cup day this Saturday | http://t.co/YAVycxMO51 pic.twitter.com/QUYiHZ0mP9
For $1.49 — the average price of a 22-ounce Slurpee — you can top off any cup or cup-like item with all the red dye and slush that will fit. Of course, there are some rules, primarily that the receptacle cannot be any larger than 10 inches in diameter. For those creative types who might look at a trash can or boot and see a cup, that's not allowed — a trash can is too big, 7-Eleven says, and a shoe is just disgusting. Cheaters, beware: There will be a display set up next to the Slurpee machine, and if your cup doesn’t fit the 10-inch diameter hole, you're done.
Of course, if you don't feel like bringing a crock pot or kiddie swimming pool with you to 7-Eleven, you can always just grab one of the regular plastic cups they always supply and walk away with a measly 40 ounces.
 
If a Carnival band in Rio did a samba-inspired cover of Madonna's "Holiday," it might sound like the version Madonna herself performed on Thursday night's Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and his house band, the Roots. The entire song is performed using (mostly) acoustic instruments that you might find in a grade school classroom, and honestly, it's a pretty great update of the 1980s hit. So relax, take a mental holiday to Brazil, or your childhood, or your car blasting an '80s rock station, and watch below. —Peter Weber
 
One person is dead and seven are injured after tornadoes left a 50-mile path of destruction across north-central Illinois.

The one recorded fatality was in the hamlet of Fairdale, which a nearby resident told  the Chicago Tribune was "pretty well destroyed" by a tornado. Rockford Fire Department division chief Matthew Knott told ABC-7 that "every single" structure in Fairdale sustained damage, and trees were uprooted, power lines down, and houses were in pieces across the entire area hit by the tornadoes. The weather also caused the cancelation of more than 800 flights out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, USA Today reports .

Your online passwords are terrible. You know that. On Last Week Tonight, Edward Snowden explained to John Oliver why that matters. "Bad passwords are one of the easiest ways to compromise a system," he said. "For someone who has a very common eight-character password, it can literally take less than a second for a computer to go through the possibilities and pull that password out."
Oliver tested out some passwords in front of Snowden, and it turns out misspelling common words or sticking in a number ("4eva") won't help you. "The best advice here," Snowden said, "is to shift your thinking from passwords to passphrases." His suggestion: something like "margaretthatcheris110%SEXY" — which is not only harder to crack but probably also easier to remember than a 13-character mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. John Oliver was impressed: "Wow, that is a password that not even a computer would guess." Now you know, but as Oliver made clear, knowing is just half the battle. —Peter Weber
