NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A Tennessee state senator says a vasectomy is a "more stringent" medical procedure than an abortion.
Republican state Sen. Todd Gardenhire of Chattanooga made the comment Tuesday at a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee during a debate on a measure to require a 48-hour waiting period for an abortion. The legislation was approved.
The measure would also require a woman to sign a form indicating she has been informed of the details of her pregnancy and the risks of an abortion.
During committee debate, Democratic Sen. Sara Kyle of Memphis said men seeking a vasectomy should have to adhere to the same standards.
Gardenhire responded that he believes a vasectomy is "a lot more stringent process" than an abortion.
