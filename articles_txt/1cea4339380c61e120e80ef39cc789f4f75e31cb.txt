A set of newly-formed super PACs backing Sen. Ted Cruz for president plans to collect more than $31 million in contributions by the end of the week — a staggering sum in support of the Texas Republican, who declared his candidacy a little more than two weeks ago.
Four affiliated super PACs, all with some variation of the name “Keep the Promise,” have registered with the Federal Election Commission as they seek to boost Mr. Cruz ’s candidacy.
Austin-based attorney Dathan Voelter is serving as treasurer of three of the four PACS, which under federal law can raise unlimited amounts of cash and don’t have to actually file disclosure reports until the end of July.
But in a statement, Mr. Voelter said the goal is to guarantee Mr. Cruz can compete against “any candidate.”
“We’re just getting started,” Mr. Voelter said. “Supporters of the senator now have a powerful vehicle with the resources necessary to aid in his effort to secure the Republican nomination and win back the White House.”
Bloomberg Politics first reported the $31 million figure and the news on the committees.
Mr. Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the only two major Republicans to have formally announced presidential bids, are tied for third in the latest Real Clear Politics average of public polling on the race for the 2016 GOP nomination.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is expected to use his deep well of fundraising connections to propel his own possible presidential run, is first at about 17 percent, with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker a close second at 16 percent.
Joining Mr. Cruz and Mr. Paul in the tie for third at about 9 percent are former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
