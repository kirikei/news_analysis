Rebranding Of Cuomo Campaign Committee Fuels Speculation He’ll Seek Third Term
April 6, 2015 1:25 PM
ALBANY, N.Y. (CBSNewYork/AP) — Is Gov. Andrew Cuomo thinking about a third term?
New York Board of Elections records show Cuomo’s campaign committee has changed its name to “Andrew Cuomo 2018.”
A spokesman for the Democrat’s campaign declined to comment Monday on the new name. The change was first reported by the Daily News, which also reported that Cuomo is holding a $15,000-a-person fundraiser in New York City on Tuesday.
Cuomo was re-elected in November and hasn’t said whether he wants a third term. Until recently, he was widely believed to be considering a presidential run in 2016.
Larry Schwartz, a former top Cuomo aide who left the administration this year, said in a statement that he would “bet anything” that Cuomo runs again.
