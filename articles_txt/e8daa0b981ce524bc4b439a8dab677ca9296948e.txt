CAMDEN, ARK. — On Wednesday, Gertrude Weaver unofficially was named the world’s oldest person, and she celebrated by having her nails painted pink and answering reporters’ questions.
Yesterday, only six days later, Weaver died at the age of 116.
Weaver died about 10 a.m. from complications of pneumonia, according to Kathy Langley, an administrator at Silver Oaks Health and Rehabilitation, where Weaver lived.
“It was absolutely unexpected; it’s quite a shock to all of us,” Langley said.
