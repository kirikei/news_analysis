ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) — New York state is giving $438,000 in support of new Americorps anti-poverty programs in the Rochester area.
Programs that receive money will help increase access to critical services for individuals in need, including child care, health care, job training and youth mentoring.
The new funding will complement the work of the Gov. Andrew Cuomo 's Rochester Anti-Poverty Task Force, as well as promote education, anti-hunger and anti-homelessness efforts throughout Monroe County.
Cuomo calls it "a crucial step forward in the fight against poverty."
A bidders' conference will be held Tuesday at the SUNY Rochester Educational Opportunity Center.
Since 1994, more than 72,000 AmeriCorps members in New York have completed more than 110 million hours of service.
