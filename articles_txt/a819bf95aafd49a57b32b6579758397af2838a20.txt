For the first time since the 1940s, D.C. is now home to three—three!—bald eagle nests. After the first nest was speculated—and later confirmed—to be in the National Arboretum , another one was discovered at the Metropolitan Police Department's training facility academy. And now, a third has been discovered at the West Campus of St. Elizabeth’s.
Not since the 1940s has D.C. been home to three Bald Eagle nests. Since the discovery of the first nest, District Department of the Environment Fish & Wildlife Biologist Dan Rauch has been snapping pictures of the nests almost daily. Above is a gallery of his most recent pictures taken at all three sites.
As DDOE director Tommy Wells told CBS DC , “We may have a habitat that can once again sustain and support nesting eagles. This is absolutely amazing.” Indeed it is.
