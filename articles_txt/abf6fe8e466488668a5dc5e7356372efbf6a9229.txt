Show me the money! Classmates.com and FTD.com announce $11-million settlement - Huntsville News | WAAYTV.com and ABC 31: Appnews
$11-million dollars.
That's how much money is up for grabs, for people who registered on Classmates.com , or purchased flowers on FTD.com .
Attorney General Luther Strange along with Attorneys General from 21 other states, settled with Classmates Inc. and FTD (Florists’ Transworld Delivery Inc.) for engaging in misleading advertising and billing practices.
These companies have a relationship with third-party companies, who used a user’s financial information.
That third-party would then enroll the user in a rewards program and would charge their credit card and bill them for offers until they cancelled.
But, the problem was the users didn't know they were signed up! 
Attorney General Luther Strange tells WAAY 31, "Consumers' financial information should never be shared without their knowledge and consent."   
If you think you have been unjustly charged, visit www.ago.alabama.gov , or write to 501 Washington Ave., Montgomery, Alabama 36104. Or, you can call (800) 392-5658 for information.
You must act quickly; complaints must be filed by August 24th.
