RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina's senior U.S. senator is promoting bipartisan legislation he says will discourage cyberattacks while keeping the personal information of citizens out of the hands of government.
Sen. Richard Burr delivered the Republicans ' weekly address released Saturday. The new chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence talked about what's called the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.
Burr, Vice Chairman Dianne Feinstein of California and John McCain of Arizona sponsored the bill that cleared the committee last month.
The senator calls the legislation a balanced approach to getting the government and private sector working together voluntarily to understand threats while protecting private, personal data.
Burr said cyberattacks represent real threats to national security.
