CHARLES CITY, Iowa (AP) — A northern Iowa school district has called on lawmakers to take legislative action on education funding.
The Charles City Community School District released a video on Monday in which students, staff and parents urge legislators to find a compromise on school funding. The Republican-majority House and Democratic-controlled Senate remain at odds over how much new money to give to schools in the upcoming academic year.
House Republicans have advanced a plan for about $100 million in additional funding, while Senate Democrats want to give schools over $200 million.
Superintendent Dr. Dan Cox says the district's video is a last-ditch effort to implore that legislators reach an agreement soon on supplemental state aid.
