WASHINGTON — Sen. Bob Menendez says he’ll beat his federal indictment once he gets to tell his story in court and he’ll continue to buck the Obama Administration during his legal troubles.
“I’m not backing off,” Menendez said on Fox News Sunday, in his first interview since being slapped with a 14-count indictment April 1.
Menendez (D-NJ) is facing federal bribery charges for allegedly accepting lavish gifts from Florida eye doctor Dr. Salomon Melgen in exchange for helping him get Medicare breaks and visas for his girlfriends.
“I know I will be vindicated and we will win,” Menendez said.
Menendez has been a tough critic of the Obama Administration for its normalization of relations with Cuba and nuclear agreement with Iran.
Asked if his federal prosecution is retribution for bucking Obama on foreign policy, Menendez didn’t take the bait.
“I cannot imagine that an administration– this administration or any other — would go to such lengths and undermine our constitutional democracy,” he said.
Mendendez stood by his legislation to insist Congress reviews the Iran nuke deal, calling it a “congressional duty.” That controversial bill — which the White House opposes — will have its first vote this week.
