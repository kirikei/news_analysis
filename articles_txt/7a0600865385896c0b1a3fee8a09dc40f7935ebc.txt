If ever there has been a player that makes his fans love him and his opponents hate him, it’s Matthew Dellavedova. Everyone involved with the Cavaliers can’t get enough of the Australian guard, but his opponents hate him more and more each game.
To become a player like that, it’s the little things more than the major moments. Sure fans get mad at LeBron James for continuing to rip their hearts out, but they hate Delly for pictures like this.
Yup, write it down right now. A shirtless Matthew Dellavedova holding a trophy and drinking a Corona is the most infuriating thing in Atlanta right now.
It doesn’t matter that he’s not a starter, or that he’s likely the fifth or sixth most important player on their team. Dellavedova just gets under fans skin for simple things like this.
What do fans find to hate about this picture? His choice of beer, of course. Only a player like Dellavedova could get all of Twitter upset because he’s enjoying a Corona while celebrating an Eastern Conference Championship. It’s just what he does, and he’s damn good at it. So keep on hating, he’s going to troll his way to an NBA Championship.
