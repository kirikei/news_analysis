Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has addressed standing-room-only, town hall-style meetings throughout his recent campaign sweep through Iowa. But, despite the crowds and enthusiasm, none of the events have completely felt like a campaign event. Something was missing.
Campaign signs. Flags. Bunting. Anything.
A casualty of an early announcement that he’s running for president, the Cruz campaign is severely lacking in swag.
The campaign, not even two weeks old, plans to open its online store soon, Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman, said. And to ship in some signs.
But without markings or posters, a few Iowans eager to hear Mr. Cruz had to ask when they arrived at an event if they were in the right place. At an event on Thursday in Cedar Rapids, a handmade poster in Magic Marker, reminiscent of a high school pep rally, directed people inside.
But at his final event of the day, in Des Moines, Mr. Cruz came across one person with a “Ted Cruz 2016” shirt.
“I had it spun up for the Iowa Ag Summit last month,” said Curt Groen, 56, who has a Facebook fan page for Mr. Cruz. “As far as I know, this shirt is the only one.”
