Final day of campaigning for Chicago mayoral candidates
Share Update:
CHICAGO (AP) — The candidates for Chicago mayor have a packed schedule today – the final day of campaigning before Election Day on Tuesday.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is seeking a second term on Tuesday. He was unable to win the necessary majority in the February election, meaning he’s locked in a runoff with Cook County Commissioner Jesus Garcia.
Emanuel and Garcia had a busy weekend campaigning across the city.
Emanuel gave remarks at a South Side church on Sunday afternoon and attended the Chicago Cubs home opener. The day before his campaign organized a rally on Chicago’s North Side.
Garcia  attended two churches, a restaurant, a rally and the Cubs game on Sunday. On Saturday, his campaign planned an appearance to address public safety and rallies to encourage voting.
Tuesday’s contest will also feature aldermanic runoffs.
