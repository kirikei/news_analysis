AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Maine's governor has vetoed a bill that sought to ensure that any pint of beer sold in the state would be 16 ounces.
Supporters of Democratic Sen. John Patrick's measure contend that some establishments use shorter glasses for beers they advertise as pints. Patrick says Mainers should get what they're paying for.
But Republican Gov. Paul LePage said in his veto message on Monday that the state already has laws protecting against deceptive trade practices and this bill would create additional financial and regulatory burdens on businesses.
LePage says that unlike some elected officials, he doesn't "believe the answer to every problem is more government, more laws and more regulation."
It would take two-thirds support in both the House and Senate to override LePage's veto.
