Harry Reid Explains How He Hurt Himself While Maintaining His ‘Firmness’
Though he doesn't explain how his ribs were broken during the “accident.”
Retiring Sen. Harry Reid joined Fusion’s Jorge Ramos to discuss a multitude of topics, including the controversial eye injury that caused him to lose the sight in his right eye – an injury Ramos said resembled the result of getting punched.
Reid described the incident as an exercise accident that occurred when a resistance band slipped and spun him around into some cabinets in his new bathroom.

“Yeah, I had a big, thick [band], that I’ve been using for about four years,” Reid said, indicating the size of the band with his hands.
“And I was trying to maintain my firmness, and that was my weight training,” he added, while flexing.

Reid explained that he had the band hooked in an anchor in the wall and, because the band didn’t have a handle, it slipped and “spun” him around, sending him into a cabinet about four feet away.
“I smashed my face into a cabinet so hard,” Reid said. “I was so fortunate that it wasn’t over just a fraction, it would have hit me in the temple.”
Breitbart investigated Reid’s story and found that, not only is his bathroom too small to perform band exercises effectively (the bands are about six feet in length), the injuries he received were beyond any that could come from a band snapping.
Steven Crowder from LouderWithCrowder.com  also refuted Reid’s story , arguing that Reid could not have performed the exercise he said he did in his bathroom and is therefore either “lying, a complete pansy (using less than 10 pounds of resistance on a glass door), or both.”
