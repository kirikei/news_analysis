BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's fire department on Tuesday ordered a nationwide safety check after a fire at a rest home in central Henan Province killed 38 people.
The fire department under the Ministry of Public Security has urged an immediate check of nursing homes, welfare houses, kindergartens, child-care centers and hospitals across the country. Local fire-fighters must ensure these centers have a sound system for safety with strict management of the use of fire and electricity.
Taking into account that most people at these venues lack the ability to take care of themselves and escape in an emergency, institutions should have proper warning and escape facilities and ensure that every person is accounted for. Regular drills will ensure timely evacuation in the event of accidents.
The Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA) which regulates rest homes also ordered a check of food safety, sanitation, service standards and public security at these venues.
The MCA also promised more funds to overhaul obsolete infrastructure and facilities and upgrade remote monitoring systems.
A fire at a private rest home in Lushan County, Henan, on Monday evening left 38 people dead and six injured.
President Xi Jinping has ordered an "all-out effort" to handle the aftermath of the fire and demanded a thorough investigation into the cause.
