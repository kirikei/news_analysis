The Republican governor filed paperwork Friday with the Illinois Secretary of State to appoint B.R. Lane as superintendent of the lottery system.
Lane is a former executive with an Indiana-based computerized gaming company called International Game Technology. He replaces Michael Jones, who left the job in March.
Both Jones and former Gov. Pat Quinn have faced criticism for trying to kill an agreement with the lottery's private manager. Illinois Attorney Lisa Madigan blocked a deal in January that would have ended the contract with Northstar Lottery Group.
Jones said straightening out the lottery's private manager model proved more difficult than he'd expected.
Lane's appointment to the $142,000-per-year post still needs approval from the Illinois Senate.
