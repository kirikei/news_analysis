KATHMANDU (AP):
The government said all children travelling in Nepal will need to be accompanied by their parents or a legal guardian to prevent the trafficking of children who lost their homes in the country's powerful earthquakes.
The Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare said yesterday the ban is aimed at protecting homeless children who are living in tent camps where there are large numbers of people.
It said an approval letter issued by a district Child Welfare Board will be needed for any other adults travelling with children from one district to another.
The earthquakes on April 25 and May 12 killed at least 8,673 people in Nepal.
