Hillary Clinton’s team has officially signed a lease on a campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, dropping the biggest hint yet that the former secretary of state is running for president in 2016.
Two Democrats familiar with the arrangement confirmed the deal to ABC News, which was first reported by Politico .
The site of the headquarters is 1 Pierrepont Plaza in the trendy neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights. According to its website , the 19-story building is marketed as “Modern offices. Brooklyn Cool.” It is located conveniently by a number of popular restaurants and stores, including by Shake Shack , Chipotle, Starbucks and Urban Outfitters . (The building is also located where Clinton Street comes to an end.)
Clinton’s decision to sign a lease may trigger a countdown clock on an announcement of a candidacy or an exploratory committee. Federal Election Committee rules dictate that you have 15 days to form a committee after “campaign activity” is conducted. The laws are murky, however, and can be hard to enforce.
The report comes after a wave of new hires for Clinton’s likely campaign. Many of the new staffers – including a number of former Obama aides and some of the Ready for Hillary workers – have been moving to New York City for the campaign over the past weeks.
Clinton’s spokesman has declined to comment on the new headquarters, but when asked earlier this week at an event in Brooklyn if she plans to return to the borough any time soon -- Clinton was quick to respond:
“All in good time,” she said, with a smile. “All in good time."
