Perry Ellis International has averted a full-blown proxy fight — for now.
Legion Partners Asset Management and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (Calstrs) withdrew their three board nominees on Tuesday after the clothing company shook up its board, although the activist investors said the family-run company should look for a new chief executive officer.
Miami-based Perry Ellis named two retail veterans — Bruce Klatsky, former CEO of Phillips-Van Heusen, and Michael Rayden, former CEO of Tween Brands — to its board last week.
Longtime Perry Ellis CEO George Feldenkreis said he would step down early next year, but named his son, Oscar, as his successor.
Legion and Calstrs, which combined own a 6.3 percent stake, say the company has underperformed its peers because it is poorly managed by the family.
“If Oscar does not perform, the board needs to fire him,” Chris Kiper of Legion told The Post. “This is not over from an agitation perspective.”
Perry Ellis shares, which had risen 54 percent since the activists began pushing for changes in July, fell 4.4 percent to $25.24 as prospects for a potential sale of the company dimmed.
