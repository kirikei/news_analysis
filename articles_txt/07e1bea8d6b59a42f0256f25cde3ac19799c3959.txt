NAIROBI (Xinhua) -- Somalia-based 'al-Shabaab' militants on Monday      night ambushed police in Kenyas northeastern Garissa county,      leaving one police officer died of injuries, an official has      confirmed.
Some 60 policemen were attacked on their way      from Dadaab and Alinjugur to aid four of their colleagues who      had been injured in a landmine explosion.
The wounded officer died during the evacuation while four      others have been airlifted to the capital Nairobi for treatment,      said Inspector General of Police, Joseph Boinett.
"All officers have been accounted for following the       ambush by the terrorists," Boinett said in a statement on       late Tuesday.
He added that two vehicles were burned by the militants,       but no civilians were affected.
"No lives of civilian population have been negatively       affected in any way," he said.
The defense forces and police are now in control of the      situation in the area and a "massive operation" is ongoing to      pursue the militants, according to the police chief.
The police earlier dismissed 'al-Shabaab's claim that 30       policemen were killed in the ambush.
In the same county last week, security forces thwarted a       planned attack by the militant group.
Boinett urged the public to work with the government in       the fight against the militants as the country is facing       growing terror threats.
