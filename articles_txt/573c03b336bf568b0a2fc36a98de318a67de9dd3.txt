OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — The Washington state Residence moved forward Friday on an effort to reconcile the state's health-related and recreational marijuana markets.
The chamber initially passed a Senate measure addressing the medical side ahead of moving on to a Property bill dealing with the recreational law. Because the Senate bill was amended in the Property, it will head back to the complete Senate for a final concurrence vote, even though the Residence bill will go next to a Senate committee for consideration.
Senate Bill 5052 passed on a bipartisan 60-36 vote right after a long debate more than numerous amendments, which includes more than whether individuals ought to have to sign up on a registry.
"No 1 has taken the thought of medical marijuana lightly," said Rep. Eileen Cody, a Democrat from Seattle. "What we're attempting to make sure is that we have a healthcare marijuana program that fits with recreational, is protected and supplies the security mechanisms for our patients that recreational enjoys. We also want to make certain that everybody has access."
Amongst its lots of provisions, the Senate measure, sponsored by Republican Sen. Ann Rivers, would generate a database of individuals. Alterations made in the Property contain creating voluntary the patient registry that was mandatory under the Senate version. On the other hand, unregistered sufferers wouldn't be allowed to possess the same amounts of marijuana or appreciate similar tax breaks that registered patients would.
Below the amended version, if a patient is entered into the database and holding an authorization card, he or she will be allowed to possess 3 instances as a great deal marijuana as is allowed below the recreational law: three ounces dry, 48 ounces of marijuana-infused solids, 216 ounces liquid and 21 grams of concentrates. Such a patient could also grow up to six plants at house, unless authorized to obtain extra by a overall health professional.
For someone who does not get an authorization card but is considered a qualified patient, the limit is the identical as the recreational limit of one ounce. Nevertheless, such a patient would be allowed to develop up to four plants and possess up to six ounces from these plants. Another alter in the Home moves the registration procedure from a doctor's workplace to a retail location.
Rep. Ed Orcutt, a Republican from Kalama, said he was concerned that the legislation was leaving "more and far more healthcare patients behind."
"I'm concerned we have restricted it also far," he mentioned. "We have limited it to the point to exactly where some of these persons are not going to be able to get the proper form or the suitable variety for what they need."
The passage of Initiative 502 in 2012 permitted the sale of marijuana to adults for recreational use at licensed stores, which started opening last summer time. Recreational businesses have complained that they're becoming squeezed by health-related dispensaries that have proliferated in lots of components of the state, providing lesser- or untaxed alternatives to licensed recreational shops.
Senate Bill 5052 would crack down on collective gardens, eliminating the current collective garden structure beginning July 1, 2016, but allowing four-patient "cooperatives." The cooperatives would be limited to a maximum of 60 plants, and the location of the collective would have to be registered with the state, and could not be within one particular mile of a licensed pot retailer. The original Senate bill would have had that distance at 15 miles.
But it would also offer an avenue for existing collective gardens to stay in company, by requiring the state Liquor Handle Board — which would be renamed the Liquor and Cannabis Board — to adopt a merit-primarily based program for granting marijuana licenses. Amongst the elements that could be regarded as are whether or not the applicant previously operated a collective garden, had a enterprise license or paid small business taxes.
Rivers stated she would encourage her colleagues in the Senate to concur with the House alterations.
"I am anxious to get this bill to the governor as soon as possible," she said in an e mail right after the vote.
The Residence measure addressing the recreational market, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Reuven Carlyle, passed on a 67-28 vote. It calls for eliminating the 3-tier tax structure voters approved in Initiative 502 and replacing it with a single excise tax of 30 % at the point of sale that everybody would have to spend, each individuals and recreational users. Nevertheless, under the bill, patients who are in the registry and have an authorization card would be exempt from sales tax on their purchases. Carlyle's bill would take effect only if the Senate's medical marijuana bill also becomes law. That is to encourage a coordinated strategy to the recreational and medical systems, ranging on problems from taxes to zoning, he said throughout the debate.
The Residence bill also diverts a share of potential tax revenue from the state's new recreational system to cities and counties. An amendment that passed would only let local bans on licensed marijuana corporations if authorized by the jurisdiction's voters.
"A nicely-regulated technique is appropriate, it is vital," Carlyle mentioned.
