Wisconsin, Milwaukee county, city and team officials hope to reach a deal this week on public financing for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena.
"The number of issues is narrowing," Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said Tuesday.
"There"s still work to be done, so there"s no white smoke. But I feel confident we"ll be able to work out the remaining issues," he said.
Officials met for about 40 minutes Tuesday in the state Capitol as they work to finalize a deal in time to have the Legislature"s Joint Finance Committee insert the financing deal in the state budget before it wraps up its work this week. The budget committee is expected to finish its work Friday or Saturday and send the budget to the Assembly and Senate for votes in June.
The Bucks want to build a $500 million arena, with $150 million coming from the owners, $100 million from former Bucks owner and former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, and $250 million from the public.
"We"re in the baking stage of the legislation," said a second source, noting the measure had already been through several drafts. "We"re getting closer."
The latest arena financing plan has a lot of moving parts, including an expanded role for the Wisconsin Center District, which operates the downtown Wisconsin Center convention facility, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena and Milwaukee Theatre, one source said.
The district would sell bonds to raise $93 million to help finance the arena, said the source, who asked not to be identified. That amount, plus interest, would be paid over several years to the investors who buy the bonds.
Those payments would come from three taxes the district levies in Milwaukee County: 3 percent on car rentals, 2.5 percent on hotel rooms and 0.5 percent on restaurant food and beverage sales.
The district now uses those taxes to pay off its debt from building the Wisconsin Center, which opened in two phases in 1998 and 2000.
By shifting future tax revenue to paying off the arena debt, any plans to use the Wisconsin Center District"s taxes to expand the convention center would likely be postponed for several years, the source said.
"That would be unfortunate," said Franklyn Gimbel, chairman of the Wisconsin Center District and a leading proponent of expanding the convention center.
Gimbel said the three taxes levied by the district generate about $30 million annually, with $22 million going to debt service and most of the rest for Visit Milwaukee, which markets the city to tourists and convention planners.
Any change in how those taxes are spent would have to be approved by state lawmakers, Gimbel said. He declined to comment further on the financial side of the plan, saying he would need to review the details.
But Gimbel said he was not opposed to expanding the role of the Wisconsin Center District so it would have some oversight of the new Bucks arena.
"I have an open mind," Gimbel said.
The City of Milwaukee would spend $35 million to build a new parking structure, with that structure"s parking fees helping pay off that debt, plus its interest. However, it wasn"t clear what additional public funds might be needed to help pay down that debt.
Also, the city would provide another $12 million through a tax incremental financing district. That money would be repaid through new property taxes tied to private development that is built within the tax financing district.
Don"t look for a property tax increase, the mayor said.
"The city and the county will be making significant contributions," Barrett said.
