JUNEAU, Alaska — The Senate Finance Committee plans confirmation hearings for Gov. Bill Walker's appointees to the Alaska Gasline Development Corp. board.
The hearings for Rick Halford, Joe Paskvan and Hugh Short are scheduled for Tuesday.
They would replace three members removed by Walker earlier this year, including former pipeline and oil company executives.
Some lawmakers have raised questions about the qualifications of former legislators Halford and Paskvan. State law requires the governor consider an individual's expertise and experience in operating, building and marketing gas pipelines; finance, large project management and other relevant experience.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski sought a legislative attorney's opinion on whether Walker's appointments met the requirements. The attorney said given the broad authority given the governor in appointing members, a court is unlikely to find his choices violate the law.
