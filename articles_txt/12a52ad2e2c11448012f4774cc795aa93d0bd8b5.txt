LOS ANGELES (AP) — Democrat Kamala Harris has raised $2.5 million since January for her U.S. Senate campaign in California.
Statewide races in California are costly, and analysts say Harris could need $30 million for the 2016 contest.
Her campaign announced Monday that Harris, the only major Democrat in the race so far, has received contributions from 47 states during the reporting period, from January through March.
The state attorney general raised $1.6 million in March alone, or an average of about $50,000 a day.
After expenditures, she has about $2.2 million in the bank.
Nearly 5,000 contributions came in amounts of $100 or less. She received about 6,500 donations overall.
Harris says in a statement she is grateful for the support.
The only established Republican in the race is state Assemblyman Rocky Chavez.
