Well, this is embarrassing. 
Have you ever had a nightmare about walking into an important meeting or presentation late and having everyone turn and stare at you? That basically came true for this guy, and he had the President of the United States to witness it. Ouch.
The embarrassed man in question is Lance Futch, a 26-year-old employee of a solar company and a member of the Air National Guard. As he told the New York Post , he showed up to a meeting at a Utah base in which a large group listened to a discussion about how to find more jobs for vets. Or so he thought.
As is typical behavior when you're going to spend the morning sitting in the last row of a crowded auditorium, Lance prepared for the day by rolling out of bed and throwing on a tousled polo shirt. And that would prove to be his most grievous mistake. When he arrived at the base he was brought into the meeting room—it was then that he found himself at a tiny table a mere two seats over from Barack freaking Obama. The god darn POTUS! 
So what's a guy to do? You man up and play it cool, that's what. You sit there at that tiny table and pretend to be listening intently to whatever the President is saying, elegantly hiding the fact that you're silently thinking "WTF?" And you sure as s--t try not to call any attention to yourself or your sloppy polo shirt.
"I was told that it was going to be an informal event—that it was going to be business casual," Lance explained to the Post . "So when President Obama walked in the room, I'm looking down at my white polo going, ‘Well, if I would have known this, I would have worn my military blues or at least a suit and tie.' I admit I was feeling a little underdressed at the moment."
He also revealed that he thought is boss was going to kill him for the mix-up. It's a valid fear, Lance!
But we stand with this brave man, who faced all of our collective fears and held his head (kind of) high. Stay strong, Lance.
