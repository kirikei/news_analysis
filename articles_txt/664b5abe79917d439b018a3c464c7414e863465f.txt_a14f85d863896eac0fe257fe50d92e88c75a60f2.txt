A genetically engineered virus has ‘cured’ patients of cancer for the first time in a breakthrough which raises hopes of an end to chemotherapy.
In a worldwide study which was led by the Institute of Cancer Research in the UK, scientists showed that the new treatment allowed some patients with skin cancer to live for more than three years – the benchmark many oncologists use to define a cure.
The therapy – called T-VEC - works by infecting and killing cancer cells while also sparking the immune system into action against tumours.
Currently most cancers are treated with using invasive chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, all of which carry the risk of further harm.
The new therapy has far fewer side effects and does not damage healthy tissue or cells.
While the breakthrough came in skin cancer patients, scientists said it raises hopes that the same process could be used for other cancers.
Charities said the development was ‘exciting’ and offered new hope to many patients.
“Patients showing responses beyond three years is something that up until now, we could only have imagined,” said Gillian Nuttall, Founder of Melanoma UK.
Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, with more than 13,000 diagnosed each year. It kills more than 2,000 people each year.
Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: “We may normally think of viruses as the enemies of mankind, but it’s their very ability to specifically infect and kill human cells that can make them such promising cancer treatments.
“In this case we are harnessing the ability of an engineered virus to kill cancer cells and stimulate an immune response.”
The clinical trials, which have been ongoing for more than three years, have been conducted in 64 centres across the UK, US, Canada and South Africa.
The results show that 163 patients with stage three and early stage four melanoma who were treated with T-VEC lived for an average of 41 months. That was compared with an average survival of 21.5 months for 66 patients who were given the current best immunotherapy drugs.
And the response was most pronounced in patients with less advanced cancers, underlining the potential benefit as a first-line treatment for metastatic cancers which cannot be surgically removed.
T-VEC is a modified form of herpes virus which multiplies inside cancer cells and bursts them from within. It has been genetically engineered to produce a molecule called GM-CSF, which stimulates the immune system to attack and destroy the tumour.
It has also been modified to remove two key genes so that it can’t replicate within healthy cells. Normal cells detect and destroy T-VEC before it can cause damage – but it replicates easily in cancer cells because their infection defences are compromised by genetic errors.
It is one of a new wave of virus-based drugs to show benefits in cancer trials, and is now the first to do so in a major randomised, controlled phase III trial.
“There is increasing excitement over the use of viral treatments like T-VEC for cancer, because they can launch a two-pronged attack on tumours – both killing cancer cells directly and marshalling the immune system against them,” said Prof Kevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research.
“Because viral treatment can target cancer cells specifically, it tends to have fewer side-effects than traditional chemotherapy or some of the other new immunotherapies.
Dr Hayley Frend, science information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: “Using a virus to both kill cancer cells and nudge the immune system into attacking them is exciting.
“Previous studies have shown T-VEC could benefit some people with advanced skin cancer but this is the first study to prove an increase in survival. The next step will be to understand why only some patients respond to T-VEC, in order to help better identify which patients might benefit from it.”
The research was also welcomed by British academics who said the results were ‘very promising.’
Prof Leonard Seymour, Professor of Gene Therapies, University of Oxford, said: “This T-Vec study shows powerful stimulus of an anticancer immune response in patients with melanoma skin cancer.
“Increasingly we understand that cancer is characterised by suppression of the immune system within tumour deposits, meaning that cancer vaccines have struggled to create useful responses.
“However T-VEC appears to be able to overcome this suppression. At this stage it’s very promising that this appears to have positive results for melanoma skin cancer.”
Muzlifah Haniff, senior lecturer Senior Lecturer and Honorary Consultant Dermatologist at Newcastle University added: “This study reports another treatment strategy based on harnessing the power of our immune system to destroy melanoma, offering new hope to many patients.”
The trial was funded by the manufacturer of T-VEC, Amgen, and is published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

‘Virotherapy’ uses modified herpes virus to attack melanoma cells and has potential to overcome cancer even when disease has spread throughout the body

Patients with aggressive skin cancer have been treated successfully using a drug based on the herpes virus, in a trial that could pave the way for a new generation of cancer treatments.
The findings mark the first positive phase 3 trial results for cancer “virotherapy”, where one disease is harnessed and used to attack another. If approved, the drug, called T-VEC, could be more widely available for cancer patients by next year, scientists predicted.
Crucially, the therapy has the potential to overcome cancer even when the disease has spread to organs throughout the body, offering hope in future to patients who have been faced with the bleakest prognosis.
Kevin Harrington, professor of biological cancer therapies at the Institute of Cancer Research London, who led the work, said: “This is the big promise of this treatment. It’s the first time a virotherapy has been shown to be successful in a phase 3 trial.”
In the trial, involving more than 400 patients with aggressive melanoma, one in four patients responded to the treatment, and 16% were still in remission after six months. About 10% of the patients treated had “complete remission”, with no detectable cancer remaining - considered a cure if the patient is still cancer-free five years after diagnosis.
The results are especially encouraging, Harrington said, because all the patients had inoperable, relapsed or metastatic melanoma with no conventional treatment options available to them. “They had disease that ranged from dozens to hundreds of deposits of melanoma on a limb all the way to patients where cancer had spread to the lungs and liver,” he said.
The treatment works by mounting a two-pronged attack on cancer. It is based on a genetically “neutered” version of the herpes virus, which has been modified to stop it producing the protein that allows it to infect healthy cells. Cancer cells then produce their own version of the blocked protein, filling in the deficit and allowing the modified virus to thrive within cancerous tissue.
The herpes multiplies vigorously inside the cancer cells until they burst open, spilling the virus into the surrounding area, triggering a secondary immune reaction against the tumour.
Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, said: “We may normally think of viruses as the enemies of mankind, but it’s their very ability to specifically infect and kill human cells that can make them such promising cancer treatments. In this case we are harnessing the ability of an engineered virus to kill cancer cells and stimulate an immune response.”
Once the immune system has been nudged into action by the T-VEC treatment, it appears to develop an enhanced ability to detect and attack cancer throughout the body. Scientists are not sure why this happens, but the latest trial confirmed the effect, showing that even secondary tumours that had not been infected by the virus shrank or disappeared.
“It’s like an unmasking of the cancer,” said Harrington. “The patient’s immune system wakes up and attacks the cancer cells wherever they are in the body.”
The therapy is given by injection and in the trial patients received a dose every two weeks for up to 18 months. The side-effects tend to be far milder than chemotherapy drugs, with patients typically experiencing mild flu-like symptoms after the first few injections.
Dr Hayley Frend, science information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: “Using a virus to both kill cancer cells and nudge the immune system into attacking them is exciting. Previous studies have shown T-VEC could benefit some people with advanced skin cancer, but this is the first study to prove an increase in survival.”
Patients with stage III and early stage IV melanoma treated with T-VEC (163 people in total) lived an average of 41 months, the trial found. This compared with an average survival of 21.5 months in the 66 earlier-stage patients who received the control treatment.
Rather than the traditional clinical trial, where a drug is compared to a placebo, the control group were given a protein designed to stimulate the immune response against cancer, but without the virus component of the treatment.
The drug, developed by the company Amgen, has been submitted to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, and could be available to US patients by next year if approved, and in Europe soon afterwards. Similar treatments are also being trialled for head and neck cancers
More than 13,000 people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma skin cancer each year in the UK, and about 88% of patients survive for more than five years. However, the survival rates for aggressive forms of skin cancer and when the cancer has spread to other organs are far worse.
The possibility that viruses could be harnessed to tackle cancer was first raised in the early twentieth century, when doctors noted that cancer patients who caught measles, hepatitis or glandular fever occasionally underwent a temporary recovery. During an early trial in 1949, patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma were injected with viral hepatitis. One patient died and 13 contracted hepatitis, but seven experienced temporary remission.
Genetic engineering, which has allowed scientists to create safe versions of natural viruses has led to a revival of the concept, and trials of virotherapies based on infections including herpes, measles and vaccinia (which was used in the smallpox vaccine) are currently underway.
