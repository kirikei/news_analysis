In the days following a third straight first-round playoff exit, St. Louis Blues head coach Ken Hitchcock didn't dwell on the what ifs or sit around wondering if general manager Doug Armstrong would relieve him from his job.
He went to work, trying to figure out what will help what is a regular-season juggernaut under his watch to be more successful in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
"I needed some time to reflect and observe," Hitchcock said at Tuesday's news conference to announce his third one-year contract in St. Louis. "Six games in the playoffs [against Minnesota] felt similar to games that I coached in the regular season. I went back and watched around twenty-four or twenty-six games of similar competition [to the post-season]. I needed to see why our team performed like we did with the peaks and valleys."
Playoff Blues under 'Hitch'
2012-13 regular season: 29-17-2, 2nd in Central
Playoffs: Lost 4-2 to L.A. in West quarter-finals.
2013-14 regular season: 52-23-7, 2nd in Central
Playoffs: Lost 4-2 to Chicago in quarters.
2014-15 regular season: 51-24-7, 1st in Central
Playoffs: Lost 4-2 to Minnesota in quarters.
Hitchcock said the six-game loss to the Wild was a direct reflection of the regular season.
"The first three games we were inconsistent. Then, boom, turn it on and play like crazy in Games 4, 5 and 6," said Hitchcock, the NHL's fourth-winningest coach who returns for a fifth season. "I needed to see if it [inconsistent play] had occurred during the season and it did. Once I had that information, it allowed me to look at the personnel and look at the players and start visualizing how could I help us keep up and excel."
Hitchcock learned that the pace of the NHL game "is like never before" and said it will be his job and that of assistant coaches Kirk Muller, Ray Bennett and Brad Shaw to get the most out of each player.
"I think, internally, we can really quicken our team," he said, "and we're going to have to, to keep up to where the league's at."
The Blues captured their second Central Division title under Hitchcock this season also boast the best regular-season record during the Edmonton native's four-year tenure at 175-79-27. Problem is, they last competed in a Western Conference final in 2001 under Joel Quenneville, now with the Chicago Blackhawks.
Ken Hitchcock gets a stay of execution. Still a great coach, just hasn't been able to take STL to next level. Muller in wings, I imagine.
Hitchcock, 63, sports an all-time regular-season record of 708-429-185 but his post-season mark over appearances is less flattering at 76-72, but does include a Stanley Cup title with Dallas in 1999.
St. Louis has gained a playoff berth in each season under Hitchcock as well as three 100-point seasons and two Central championships.
Hitchcock has enjoyed other successes including:
Becoming the fourth coach in NHL history to reach 700 regular-season victories on March 12, 2015.
Becoming the fourth coach in Blues history to be named NHL coach of the year in 2012.
Leading his teams (Dallas, Philadelphia, Columbus, St. Louis) to eight division titles and 11, 100-point seasons.
Coaching Canada to a silver medal at the 2008 world hockey championship.
Winning an Olympic gold medal as associate coach with Canada in 2002, 2010 and 2014.
But in a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately business, defenceman Kevin Shattenkirk was St. Louis' leading scorer in these playoffs with eight assists while right-winger Vladimir Tarasenko, the team's top point-getting in the regular season with 73, added six goals and seven points in the post-season.
T.J. Oshie, Alex Steen, Jaden Schwartz, David Backes, Paul Stastny and Ryan Reaves combined for six goals.
Blues general manager Doug Armstrong said there was a decided change in the style of players added for this season, a list that included forwards Stastny (four-year, $28-million US free-agent contract) and Jori Lehtera.
'We are going to have a different look [to start next season]. We're going to explore improving our team to levels that we haven't explored in the past, but it has to make sense.'
- Blues GM Doug Armstrong
"We went through the ebbs and flows of those types of players," Armstrong told reporters. "I'm not saying they're not competitive players … but when you spend upwards of four, five years before Ken got here and what we were trying to build and you add different style of players in there, I thought there were some bumps in the road that we haven't had in the past. I thought those bumps continued in the playoffs.
"We are going to have a different look [to start next season]. We're going to explore improving our team to levels that we haven't explored in the past, but it has to make sense," Armstrong added.
The GM's immediate focus will be re-signing the Blues' restricted free agents, a pool that includes goalie Jake Allen, defenceman Robert Bortuzzo and Tarasenko. Armstrong also mentioned there could be a conversation with the representative for left-winger Schwartz, who will be a RFA next summer.
"We believe we're fortunate to have two cores — an aging core of players in their late 20s to early 30s and we have a young core in their lower to mid-20s," said Armstrong. "I want to make sure we're servicing both of those cores but understanding the long-term look at this franchise is with Schwartz, Tarasenko, [defenceman] Alex [Pietrangelo], Shattenkirk [and] Allen."
Hitchcock said it's the first time since he arrived in St. Louis that he sensed anger and disappointment from his players following a playoff loss.
"This is the first time I've seen that the players feel like we underperformed in the playoffs from what we did in the regular season," he said. "I think we're going to see an even higher level of focus [next season] than we've seen. I think we're going to see a whole other gear."

Given the chance to repeat the tried, predictable, failed solution, the Blues this time decided to bring back an experienced head coach, even if they needed four weeks to maintain their grip.
The easy step for ownership and general manager Doug Armstrong would have been to dismiss Ken Hitchcock following another postseason limp, then market the team around a younger, “exciting,” player-friendly bench figure prone to yell at referees and maybe hurl a stick or two. The Blues briefly groped for free agent Mike Babcock, then returned to what they know, a future Hall of Fame coach who insists he remains open to change — and hopefully a second-round playoff win — at age 63.
The “search” may have been a bit clumsy. The resulting statement is laudable: If success should be shared, disappointment can be, too.
On Tuesday night, Armstrong called his shared tenure here with Hitchcock a glass three-quarters full. “When we got here, we were a poor team. Now we’re a good team that has a poor playoff record,” Armstrong said.
Hitch won a Jack Adams Award as NHL coach of the year his first season here. The Blues amassed 50 regular-season wins the last two. The other was a strike season that never found its legs locally. No team has amassed more points than the Blues have under Hitchcock the last four seasons.
“I like what Ken has brought to the franchise. He’s has been a reason for success. There are others as well. But we have to take the playoff failure as a group. ... That includes the players. I don’t want to believe they’re not culpable,” said Armstrong, the roster maker.
Hitchcock returns on a one-year deal, not ideal given the need for “buy-in” but also not unique to his St. Louis term. The Blues reject the “lame-duck” tag as a ready reason for players who might experience Hitchcock fatigue. Given the team’s lack of playoff resilience, I’m not so sure. As the adage holds, if you want a reason to fire a coach, just ask a player.
Asked about the possibility his grinding style worsens late-season fatigue, Hitch offered no apologies. “I don’t think that’s valid at all. I want the accelerator down when we play.”
Armstrong called the theory “a made-up fallacy.” Hmmm.
Yet the delay between the Minnesota Wild’s six-game dismissal of the Blues and Tuesday’s announcement also allowed for an exchange of ideas and critiques between longtime friends.
The coach admits his presence can increase “the squeeze” on his team. A holdover coaching staff may take on more speaking parts. Hitchcock also recognized a need for this team to play faster and more “reckless,” a reference to possible role changes. It’s fair to speculate if David Backes’ lasting move from center to right wing looms and if $28 million man Paul Stastny’s promotion to one of the first two lines is the vehicle to make it happen. Robert Bortuzzo and Petteri Lindbohm must be considered two of the top seven defensemen, a commitment that could alter Barret Jackman’s status.
By retaining Hitchcock, Armstrong has also doubled down on his role.
The Blues can’t expect buy-in from a jilted fan base with mere tweaks to a roster that’s never experienced the thrill of winning a second-round playoff game.
Worse, this franchise has built a reputation for quick, messy folds when faced with April deficits.
Armstrong must know this. At core, his record here is Hitchcock’s record.
The Blues have shown themselves too gifted, too potentially special to completely disassemble. However, they’ve played the same off-key tune for so many springs that the status quo is unacceptable. It’s time for management to address the postseason missing man formation.
Armstrong said he didn’t want Hitchcock to return “out of anger and disappointment.” He prefers passion for the job.
“This is unfinished business for me,” Hitchcock said at Tuesday’s presser. “I don’t want to coach to coach. I want to coach to win.”
The quote was part TLR, part Rockne. It needs to translate with a room that possesses inarguable talent but an inconsistent carburetor.
“Embrace your skill, trust your work,” is how Hitchcock puts it. He perceived inconsistent work habits before January, achieved a balance for three months, then believes the club reverted against the Wild.
“We didn’t value the work part of the game,” Hitchcock said. “It popped up in the playoffs. It wasn’t there all the time. You’ve got to have that balance. I felt we were the other way. We were discouraged too easily. Other coaches have to sell it. It’s not just me. The players have to demand it.”
No doubt Hitchcock’s words may rankle a portion of the room. Neither owner Tom Stillman nor Armstrong has denied rub between coach and players. The explanation is it happens universally.
Change isn’t confined to rank and file. Different buttons need to be pushed. To a long-enduring fan base, January’s play list isn’t so seductive when the April set is so off key. “The league went faster this year than it ever had before. We’ve got to get caught up,” Hitchcock said. “It’s not the personnel. It’s how you play the personnel. You can get quicker in a hurry by moving players” on the ice.
The Blues revealed much of their strategy Tuesday at Scottrade Center. Next season will either be more fulfilling or be Hitchcock’s last here.
Armstrong insists his relationship with Hitchcock isn’t the controlling element. Hitchcock learned the job was not automatically his if he wanted it.
“It didn’t weigh on me,” Armstrong insisted. “It’s a 20-year friendship that we have. This is just part of the job responsibility. Every day any coach or manager is one day closer to being relieved of his duties. It’s the nature of the sport. If you want more security go into college sports.”
The Blues have narrowed the options for changing next season’s mix. Some players may get their wish for an altered style. Others may find themselves in a different city. Hitchcock is back for a season. The roster rubs the salary cap. One gets the feeling this is the last time for wait ’til next year.
