Missouri House endorses refund application after tax audits
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) _ Lawmakers say a measure moving forward in the Missouri House is needed to provide fairness to taxpayers audited after the statute of limitations has passed.
The Missouri House gave first-round approval Wednesday to a measure that lets taxpayers apply for a refund if an audit by the Department of Revenue initiated after the statute of limitations has passed finds they have overpaid taxes.
Republican Rep. Rocky Miller, of Tuscumbia, says taxpayers should get the chance to get money back if the revenue department can collect from them after an audit even when the statute of limitations has passed.
The measure passed on a voice vote and faces another vote before moving to the Senate.
