FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) — Arizona's two senators and some members of its congressional delegation are disputing the impending release of an immigrant with tuberculosis in Pinal County.
Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake , along with representatives Ann Kirkpatrick and Paul Gosar, urged U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to reconsider in a letter Friday.
According to Pinal County Director of Public Health Thomas Schryer , an ICE detention facility in Florence will release the immigrant, who is in the country illegally, because the agency has no legal reason to hold him.
Schryer says the immigrant has been receiving treatment for the past seven months for a drug-resistant form of TB.
Gosar says his release will jeopardize residents and impose financial burdens on the county.
An ICE spokeswoman did not return a request seeking comment Sunday.
