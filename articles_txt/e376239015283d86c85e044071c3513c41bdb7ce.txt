Kylie Jenner took to Instagram on Tuesday, May 26 to share two sexy photos from her latest photoshoot. In the first picture, the 17-year-old reality star flashed her underboobs in a brown semi-sheer crop top with strategic cut-outs covering her nipples.
The " Keeping Up with the Kardashians " star paired the sexy top with blue high-waisted, knitted shorts, a white fur coat and gold strappy heels. She lied down near a swimming pool with her eyes closed. She first captioned it, "This is how I sunbathe with @sir_neave," before changing it to, "Secret projects @sir_neave."

On Monday, Kylie seemingly threw shade to Blac Chyna by posting a photo of herself in outfit similar to Tyga 's baby mama. Blac was the first to share a photo of her posing in her bathroom wearing a tight turtleneck crop top and skinny pants. An hour later, Kylie shared a photo of her in a grey crop top and skinny pants along with caption, "Snap."
