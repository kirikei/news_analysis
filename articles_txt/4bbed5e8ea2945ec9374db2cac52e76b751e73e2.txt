MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin lawmaker has introduced a bill that would ban felons from owning vicious dogs.
Rep. Andre Jacque , a De Pere Republican, says Green Bay police are seeing an increase in dog fighting cases and dogs attacking officers.
Jacque says the bill doesn't target a certain breed of dog but instead calls for police to weigh the dog's behavior and determine if it's vicious. The bill says a dog that causes physical harm or leads an officer to believe it poses a significant threat could be considered vicious.
Felons found in possession of a vicious dog could face up to $10,000 in fines and six years in prison.
