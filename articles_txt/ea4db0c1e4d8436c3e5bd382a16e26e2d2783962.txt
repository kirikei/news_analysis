Hackers steal personal financial information straight from the IRS

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The IRS says hackers were able to access personal financial information for 104,000 taxpayers.
The hackers used the IRS website's service called "Get Transcript" to access thousands of people's tax forms.
The tool is designed as an easy way to download several years of tax forms for tasks like applying for a mortgage or financial aid.
But, in order to access the information, the hackers needed to use the personal data they had already stolen including Social Security numbers, birth dates, physical addresses, and personal identity verification questions.
The thieves then used the information to claim about 15,000 people's tax refunds.
The IRS has temporarily disabled the "Get Transcript" service and is offering protection to all the people whose information was stolen.
