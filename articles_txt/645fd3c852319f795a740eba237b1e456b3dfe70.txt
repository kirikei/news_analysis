FIVE Sydney children trying to return from Syria have every chance of being reintegrated into Australian society, an expert says.
THE three sons and two daughters of Australian IS recruit Khaled Sharrouf were taken to the warzone by their mother, Tara Nettleton, soon after Sharrouf's departure in December 2013.
Ms Nettleton's family are now reportedly trying to repatriate her and the children, one of whom was photographed holding a severed head at age seven.
One of the teenage girls has reportedly been married to Australian IS fighter Mohamed Elomar.
ANU radicalisation expert Dr Clarke Jones says the children have clearly witnessed "atrocious acts" and suffered bouts of indoctrination and desensitisation.
"They have certainly been well indoctrinated in the IS beliefs," Dr Jones said.
Separation from their parents could deepen their trauma but there's a good chance they could be reintegrated with guidance and proper schooling, he said.
"I do think it's possible at that age to help them and steer them in the right direction with positive role models and positive counselling," he told AAP.
"They're going to need all the love, attention and care from more stable people than what their parents are."
Prime Minister Tony Abbott says Ms Nettleton will face the full force of the law if she returns to Australia.
The children could be placed in state care.
There is no indication Mr Sharrouf wants to return.
Dr Jones says the children's case is the most unusual and complex he has heard of.
He fears for their safety if they are identified by members of the Australian public and says they could need protective custody.
He has previously been abused for encouraging compassion toward Muslims, he said.
"If they (abusers) don't like what I say then God, I'd hate to think how they'll treat kids with such a notorious father," he said.
Some comments on social media are wishing death on the entire family, while one user says they hope they will be beheaded for trying to leave IS.
