Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus “Chuy” Garcia headed into the final weekend before Electio
Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus "Chuy" Garcia headed into the final weekend before Election Day by gearing up to try to make sure their supporters cast ballots in the runoff election.
The mayor was set to do a made-for-TV phone-banking stop Friday morning at his campaign field office on the Near West Side, making calls to people his campaign has identified as likely Emanuel backers to urge them to vote. Election Day is Tuesday, but both campaigns have been pushing hard for supporters to vote early or vote by mail rather than wait and risk bad weather or busy schedules getting in the way.
Garcia was scheduled to appear Friday afternoon with Rev. Jesse Jackson to talk to seniors in the South Side Chatham neighborhood. Jackson has endorsed Garcia, and could be helpful in convincing a larger share of Chicago's African-American voters to back the challenger.
Garcia will also hold a news conference Friday at a school in Logan Square to talk about "funding for public education priorities," according to his campaign. Garcia, who is backed by the Chicago Teachers Union, has worked to make Emanuel's school agenda an issue in the race.
And Emanuel will make a technology jobs announcement, according to the mayor's office. Emanuel has tried to position himself as a better candidate than Garcia to bring jobs into the city and deal with Chicago's economic problems.
