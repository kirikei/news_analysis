Burundi crisis a key issue for AU summit
ONE of the key pillars of the African Union’s (AU’s) preventive diplomacy is to avert war and conflict before it rears its ugly head. It is therefore not enough to share the burden of conflict mediation, as the East African Community (EAC) and SA are doing on Burundi, without getting to the root cause of the problem, which is attempts by sitting heads of states to extend their stay in power by amending constitutions (or reinterpreting them).
A few weeks ago, forces loyal to President Pierre Nkurunziza stymied a coup d’état in Burundi. A few months earlier, the exact opposite occurred, when an army officer in Burkina Faso, Lt-Col Isaac Zida, dislodged the president of that country, Blaise Compaoré. After Burkina Faso’s suspension from the AU and pressure from the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), Zida has morphed into a civilian as prime minister, with Burkina Faso returning to "civilian rule" a month later.
Burundi is in the throes of heightened political uncertainty with legislative and presidential elections set for next month in doubt. After a bloody civil war and a peace process that ushered the country into a democratic state-building exercise from 2004, Burundi is now on the verge of full-scale conflict. These developments are worrying after the considerable investments in peace and post-conflict reconstruction by the United Nations, the Nordic countries and SA over the past 15 years.
Similarly, in Togo, although the crisis did not escalate, Faure Eyadema’s election to a third term as president last month illustrated the palpable tension that accompanies a longer stay in power.
If the mooted constitutional amendments in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Benin and the Republic of Congo are factored in, instability becomes a real likelihood. More worrying is the fact that these are now undermining neighbouring countries, increasing the potential for regional insecurity. This should be of concern to regional economic communities where peace and state building are in their infancy after years of war, bad governance and political instability.
The initiative in Dar es Salaam by the EAC and SA in averting a full-scale crisis in Burundi provides a framework for getting this pressing issue on to the agenda of next month’s AU summit in SA.
In a strong criticism of this trend, at the AU’s Peace and Security Council in January, President Jacob Zuma raised concern about "a worrying trend of constitutional amendments aimed at extending the mandates of incumbent heads of state and government".
The AU and SA can pursue one or two of three options. First, to send a strong signal, Zuma can echo his January statement at next month’s summit. The second, potentially more problematic, is for the AU Commission’s chairwoman, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to use her statement to draw a link between conflict and constitutional amendments in broad terms, including their effect on development and regional security.
The third option, less onerous, is for the AU Commission to produce a position paper on early-warning and preventive diplomacy instruments, which could be ready for the January 2016 summit.
This would require far more substantive consultations and discussions through existing instruments such as the Peace and Security Council, the AU Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, and including the AU Constitutive Act.
The political crisis in Burundi is one too many. Aspiration 4 of the AU’s Agenda 2063: The Future We Want seeks to silence the guns by 2020. This is a noble precondition for the more pressing task of economic development. But it could prove elusive if the AU does not proactively deal with constitutional amendments for third and fourth terms as a new threat to stability, peace and regional security.
