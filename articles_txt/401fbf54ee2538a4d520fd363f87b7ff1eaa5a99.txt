Your Right to Know
OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Senate passed a bill yesterday that would allow nitrogen gas as an execution method, a measure adopted after the flawed 2014 lethal-injection execution of an inmate whose intravenous line was improperly placed by death-chamber workers.
The legislation, approved by the state Senate on a 41-0 vote after being passed by the House on an 85-10 vote in March, is headed to the desk of Gov. Mary Fallin.
The measure would allow state authorities to consider nitrogen gas as an alternate method of execution if the U.S. Supreme Court determines in an upcoming case that the state’s current lethal-injection process is unconstitutional.
The nitrogen method of execution would require an inmate to be placed in a sealed chamber or to wear a special mask. The process would involve slowly replacing oxygen with nitrogen.
