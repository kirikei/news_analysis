RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - State lawmakers are set to consider this week whether there should be tighter gift rules for elected officials and looser restrictions on surveillance technology used by police.
Legislators are due back in Richmond on Wednesday for the so-called “veto session” where they will consider vetoes and amendments made by Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.
McAuliffe has proposed changes to more than 50 pieces of legislation, including ethics reform and police surveillance legislation.
Republicans are unlikely to be able to overturn the governor’s vetoes, which included several pro-gun bills, with an evenly split Senate. Both chambers need a two-thirds vote in order to overturn a veto.
