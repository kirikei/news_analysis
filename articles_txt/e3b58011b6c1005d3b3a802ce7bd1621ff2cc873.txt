You've probably been reading a lot about Indiana, with the possibility that its now-revised religious freedom bill will allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people. Now, Arkansas was dangerously close to implementing a nearly identical law.
The good news is: many important people and businesses have voiced their support for the LGBT community in the form of public statements, thoughtful articles, and even boycotts. Regardless of what happens in the state government, LGBT youth in Indiana and Arkansas need resources and support. Here are some fantastic LGBT-focused organizations in those states that you should know about:
IN INDIANA:
IN ARKANSAS:
Pridecorps is an organization for LGBT youth ages 14-20 in central Arkansas. They meet every Saturday to host groups with a fun and educational component. They explore topics including coming out, substance abuse and mental health, suicide prevention, bullying and harassment, self-esteem, safe sex, wellness, and nutrition.
ARTEC is working to advance equality, justice, and inclusiveness for transgender and gender non-conforming Arkansans through a statewide trans-led organization. Their resources include grassroots activism and advocacy, social events, health resources, and referral services.
If you're feeling isolated, confused, or lonely -- remember that wherever you are, you're not alone. There is a community waiting to love and support you. If you're looking for events, services, or simply new LGBT-friendly spaces and people, check out the It Gets Better Project's guide to resources in your state.
