UNDATED (AP) — Two people  familiar with the situation tell The Associated Press that Tom Brady’s  appeal of his four-game suspension for his role in the deflated  footballs scandal won’t be heard by Wednesday’s 10-day deadline.
Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity Monday because no date for the appeal has been set. The collective bargaining
agreement  calls for it to be heard within 10 days. However, the league and the  players’ union can agree on delaying the hearing. The two sides don’t  agree on much else.
The union asked Commissioner Roger Goodell to  recuse himself from hearing the appeal because it said he lacked  impartiality and he would be called as a witness.
Goodell will not  withdraw from what he considers his responsibility of hearing the  appeal, according to several people with knowledge of the decision.

BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq on Tuesday announced the launch of a military operation to drive the Islamic State group out of the western Anbar province, where the extremists captured the provincial capital, Ramadi, earlier this month.
Iraqi state TV declared the start of the operation, in which troops will be backed by Shiite and Sunni paramilitary forces, but did not provide further details.
