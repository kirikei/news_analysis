Michelle Obama struts her stuff at the Easter Egg Roll.
WASHINGTON, DC - The President and the First Lady hosted the 137th annual White House Easter Egg Roll Monday...and it's clear as day, Mrs. Obama can bust a move!
The theme for this year was "Gimme Five," in honor of the First Lady's "Let's Move" exercise initiative, which was introduced five years ago.
The First Lady showed off choreographed dance moves with the "So You Think You Can Dance" All Stars, and got the crowd up on its feet and moving.
