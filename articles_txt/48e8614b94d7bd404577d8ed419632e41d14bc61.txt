Serena Williams is not above having fun with her games at the French Open.
The women's No. 1 tennis player cracked herself up after she flubbed a deceptively easy-looking lob during her first-round match against Andrea Hlavackova at Roland Garros on Tuesday. 
Williams got fooled by the awkward spin of the shot during the first set and let out a squeal as she got plunked by the ball before bursting into laughter:
Williams maintained her sense of humor when describing the funny episode: 
"I'm allegedly a professional tennis player. And I was thinking, 'I'm going to hit a backhand.' 'I will hit a forehand.' And, 'I will run around and hit a backhand.' 'No, no, no, run around and hit a forehand.' Next thing I know, it hit me in the back," Williams said. "So I was, like, embarrassed. At the same time, I thought it was really funny. It happens to the best of us. Maybe not. But to me."
Despite the brain fart, Williams easily dispatched Hlavackova in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, to advance to the second round.
