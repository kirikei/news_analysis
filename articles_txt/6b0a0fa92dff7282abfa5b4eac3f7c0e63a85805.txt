Our view: Despite scandals, state Legislature incumbents still too comfortable
Saved
There's never been a shortage of proposals to reform the corruption culture that pervades our state government, but the truth is that there's no single ethics measure that would be the cure-all.
But there is one area of ethics reform that should be a priority: elections.
New York has weak campaign finance laws, a deeply flawed redistricting process (that will only be marginally better under the system that legislators fooled voters into approving last fall), woefully inadequate election law enforcement. All of these and a host of other election-related issues contribute to the biggest obstacle to fixing Albany: incumbent entrenchment.
A new Siena Research Institute poll released Monday is a perfect illustration of the problem. Pollsters found that 90 percent of voters say corruption a very serious or somewhat serious problem for New York state goverment.
But how would that affect elections?
The poll found that half of voters said the recent Albany scandals (which include the leaders of both houses being arrested weeks apart on public corruption charges) will have no affect on how they vote. And just 37 percent said they are less likely to vote for their incumbent.
That's sad but not surprising, because the state Legislature has established a system that gives incumbent nearly insurmountable advantages when it comes to elections.
And if we're every going to see meaningful and lasting reform, the kind that would keep elected officials out of handcuffs, changes to how we elect state officials must be made.
