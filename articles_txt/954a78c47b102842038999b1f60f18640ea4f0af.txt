Shirley Abrahamson
MADISON, Wis (WSAU-Wheeler News)  A judge will hold a hearing April 21st on Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson's lawsuit which seeks to keep her leadership post on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Yesterday Madison Federal Judge James Peterson rejected Abrahamson's request to block a constitutional amendment approved by voters on Tuesday. It gives the seven justices the authority to pick a new chief, rather than giving the post to the one with the most seniority. The judge said Abrahamson did not explain why he should block the law without hearing from the defendants first. Also, Peterson said she would not suffer any harm in the short term, since state officials won't certify the referendum results until April 29th.
Judge Peterson said he would reconsider the injunction request if new evidence shows a need for it. The request seeks to block the justices' vote on a chief at least until Abrahamson's lawsuit goes through the courts. With a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, the liberal Abrahamson is expected to lose her chief justice post, and be demoted to a regular justice, if the election is held.
The 81-year-old Abrahamson has been the chief since 1996. Among other things, she said voters re-elected her because of her chief's position -- and she should keep it at least until the end of her current 10-year term in 2019.
