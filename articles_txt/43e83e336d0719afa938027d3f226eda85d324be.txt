UNDATED (WSAU-Wheeler News)  Two Wisconsin legislative committees held public hearings yesterday on a bill to create statewide standards for online ride-sharing services. One question that came up was whether drivers could discriminate, by not taking some ride requests. Uber official Robert Kellman told the Assembly Government Operations Committee that his company's drivers must agree to what he called as thorough of an anti-discrimination policy that could possibly be made.
Assembly Democrat Lisa Subeck of Madison said Uber's driver agreement policy appears to contrast Kellman's claim. Subeck, who's also on the Madison City Council, said local communities should be the ones to regulate the industry. Assembly Republican Tyler August of Lake Geneva, the bill's main sponsor, says a hodge-podge of local ordinances has caused a lack of ride-sharing services in rural areas that don't have taxis. Kellman said that under a statewide standard, drivers wouldn't have to worry about breaking various local rules -- and it would allow riders to go care-free from Milwaukee to Wisconsin Dells if they choose. Taxi officials questioned the need for the bill, and said lawmakers ran the risk of "crushing" the existing cab industry.
The bill requires state licenses for ride-sharing firms like Uber. Companies must also arrange criminal background checks, and have at least a million dollars in liability insurance. The Assembly panel plans a recommendation vote on the measure next Wednesday. A Senate committee held a hearing yesterday on an identical, and it plans a vote on April 16th.
