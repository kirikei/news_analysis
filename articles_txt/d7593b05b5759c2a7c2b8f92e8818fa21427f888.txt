Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid went through multiple surgeries, but vision has not returned to his right eye.
In an interview with Fusion that aired Tuesday, the Nevada Democrat told anchor Jorge Ramos that he’s “sightless” in the eye that was injured in a New Year’s Day exercise-band accident.
But Reid said he has moved beyond the concerns about not being able to see in the eye.
“No, I’m over that, ’cause I can’t see out of my eye, and that’s the way it’s going to be until something comes along that’ll change it,” Reid said in the interview. “Right now, I’ve had 11 hours of surgery. They’ve tried. I can’t see out of my right eye. And that’s OK, I can live with that.”
At an event Monday in Nevada, Reid told an audience, “I’m actually blind now in my right eye, and so … I’ll develop better depth perception, but now I don’t have any, so it’s hard for me sometimes to navigate.”
“But as I said, it’s getting better every day,” Reid said.
