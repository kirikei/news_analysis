APRIL 8, 2015
The George Washington Bridge lane closing scandal in September 2013 led to questions about the hardball culture of the staff of Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, as he sought to turn a re-election victory into an argument that he was his party’s best hope for the White House in 2016. It also pried open the lid of the normally opaque Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, exposing other matters for investigators. Here are seven of the many unanswered questions. For a detailed diagram of connections between more than two dozen key players, view this page on a device with a larger screen.
A lane of traffic may run straight, but the lines connecting the players in the George Washington Bridge lane closing scandal are more of a Spaghetti Junction.
The closings in September 2013 led to questions about the hardball culture of Gov. Chris Christie’s staff as he sought to turn a re-election victory into an argument that he was the Republican Party’s best hope for president in 2016.
They also pried open the lid of the normally opaque Port Authority, exposing other questions for investigators: about conflicts of interest by the authority’s chairman; accusations that storm aid was used as leverage in a development deal; and of whether the New Jersey governor’s office used the authority as a piggy bank to fill holes in the state budget.
The traffic cones were still in place when the mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, told officials that he thought he was being punished; it took three months for his suspicions to be publicly confirmed. Bill Baroni, the authority’s deputy executive director, testified at a legislative hearing in November — not under oath — that the closings were part of a traffic study. Bridge officials testified a week later that there was no study.
So who knew the truth and when? Mr. Christie denies knowing about the closings as they happened, or their planning. Other officials in the administration and at the Port Authority have likewise denied any wrongdoing.
Here is a guide to key players and issues to watch.

Wildstein: “Got it”
The messages were sent soon after Ms. Kelly, Christie’s deputy chief of staff, learned that the mayor of Fort Lee, N.J., Mark Sokolich, was not going to endorse the governor for re-election.
A few weeks later, Mr. Wildstein, an official at the authority, directed workers to close access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, causing gridlock over four days. (The plan was to close them for a month.)
2. When did Mr. Christie, famous as a hands-on manager, know about his staff’s involvement?
Besides Ms. Kelly, several other staff members were aware that Mr. Sokolich suspected he was being punished even before the closings ended.
3. When did Christie staff members and a Port Authority lawyer know there was no traffic study behind the closings?
Christie’s chief counsel, Charles McKenna, two other aides, and Phillip Kwon, a lawyer for the authority, all helped to prepare testimony given by Bill Baroni, Christie’s No. 2 at the authority, that the lane closings were part of a traffic study. That testimony was discredited a week later.
4. Mr. Wildstein says “evidence exists” that Mr. Christie knew of the lane closings. If so, what is it?
Christie denies that he had knowledge of the closings or their planning, but Mr. Wildstein has asserted otherwise, without providing specifics.
5. Did Mr. Christie’s staff members display a pattern of political retribution?
One possible example: Administration and Port Authority officials were scheduled to meet with Steven M. Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City. When Mr. Fulop announced his support for Christie’s opponent, the officials canceled the meetings and cut off contact.
6. Did the Port Authority chairman mix official business with his firm’s business?
David Samson, Christie’s top appointee, is under scrutiny for a lightly used United Airlines route that was nicknamed “The Chairman’s Flight.” It ran from Newark to Columbia, S.C., near his weekend home, and was dropped shortly after he resigned.
Clients of his law firm have benefited from an authority takeover of the Atlantic City airport and two large bridge projects:
Goethals Bridge
Total cost: $1.3 billion
7. Did a spending maneuver break laws on bond issues or violate S.E.C. rules?
Mr. Christie pushed hard to have the decaying Pulaski Skyway redefined as an access road to the Lincoln Tunnel (which is several miles away), shifting costs of more than $1 billion from New Jersey to the authority.
