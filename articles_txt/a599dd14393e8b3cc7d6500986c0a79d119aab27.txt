Abraham Lincoln was probably in a good mood when he took his seat in a plush rocker at Ford's Theatre.
"That last day of his life was one of the happiest days he'd had in a long time, knowing the war was going well, having a long talk with Mary about what they might do after the presidency was over," said renowned historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Doris Kearns Goodwin.
But there would be no retirement, no chance to see the country through the post-Civil War era. The night of April 14, 1865, during a performance of "Our American Cousin," John Wilkes Booth would gain access to the president's box, point a pistol at Lincoln's head and fire the shot that would take a great and good man's life the next morning.
On Monday, Goodwin will visit the Henry Ford  in Dearborn for the first time. The author of "Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln" — the best seller adapted into Steven Spielberg's 2012 film "Lincoln" — is looking forward to seeing the Henry Ford Museum and, especially, its priceless objects that make the lives of icons seem real.
Objects like the chair where Lincoln spent his final happy moments of that fateful day.
The chair arrived at Greenfield Village in winter 1929 in a crate addressed: “Mr Henry Ford, Dearborn, Michigan.”

"To actually see the chair is a way, I think, to celebrate the life, not just that this was the moment where he was shot," said Goodwin,  who has also chronicled the Kennedys, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, and most recently Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft.
To commemorate the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's death, the Henry Ford is holding two special events. Goodwin will speak Monday night at a sold-out event about Lincoln's relevance to 2015.
Then on Wednesday, Henry Ford Museum will offer free admission, courtesy of Target. Visitors can see Lincoln-related artifacts, watch a video about the Emancipation Proclamation and receive a free souvenir program.
For that day, the Lincoln chair will be taken out of its regular glass case and moved to a prominent spot at the front of the "With Liberty & Justice for All" exhibit.
At 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Wednesday, museum curators and staffers will hold a panel discussion near the chair on the most frequently asked questions about the artifact. Questions like: Why is it in Dearborn instead of Ford's Theatre? Where did it go after the assassination? And, typical of the "CSI" age, what exactly are those stains on the upper part of the chair?
The experts will share all the details, including the role that hair oil, a popular grooming item of the 1860s, played in those stains.
'Legacy ... still with us'
The Lincoln chair is more than a symbol of tragedy, just as Lincoln remains more than just another commander in chief.
Contemporary headlines on the police killings of unarmed African-American men demonstrate that the struggle to live up to its ideals continues for a nation "dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal," as Lincoln wrote in his famous Gettysburg Address.
"Obviously we've come an enormous distance from where we were (150 years) ago, but the legacy of the combination of slavery and then segregation and Jim Crow and economic problems, it's still with us," said Goodwin.
During his effort to preserve the Union, Lincoln sought ways to lift the melancholy and depression of his temperament and political burdens. As the chair indicates, theater was one of his go-to escapes.
"It's so important for leaders to figure out whatever way is for them to just replenish their energy and just have time to get away from the pressures," said Goodwin. "Theater was a part of that (for Lincoln). Again, that chair means even more than the moment he died. It represents lots of moment in his presidency where he could not think about everything else that was happening."
The Lincoln chair also speaks to our enduring reverence for the leader who perches today on a marble in a memorial on Washington, D.C.'s Mall.
According to Donna Braden, curator of public life at the Henry Ford, who'll be part of the panel talks Wednesday, the chair, a wooden rocker upholstered in red fabric that shows the wear and tear of time, wasn't part of the normal Ford's Theatre seating. Rather, it was provided only for VIP guests — and nobody was a more important playgoer at the time than Lincoln.
After the assassination, the chair was taken away by the government and used as evidence in the trial of conspirators working with Booth, who was found and wounded during a massive manhunt and died in Virginia about a week and a half after the assassination.
Before its confiscation, the War Department received complaints that the chair had been the target of souvenir hunters looking to take away pieces of it as relics, according to the book "Legacies: Collecting America's History at the Smithsonian."
It eventually wound up in storage at the Smithsonian Institution. In 1929, it was reclaimed by the widow of a Ford's Theatre co-owner, Harry Ford, and almost immediately auctioned for a reported $2,400. The buyer was an agent who acquired it for another person named Ford, this one an automotive tycoon.
'Tangible piece of evidence'
Henry Ford "really revered Lincoln, all of the values of Lincoln, the humble, self-made man, the ordinary man who seized opportunity and raised himself up, all the things Henry Ford could relate to himself," said Braden.
When Ford opened Greenfield Village in October 1929, one of its treasures was the Logan County Courthouse, which he brought from Illinois and lovingly restored in order to display a place where young Lincoln had practiced law. Braden says Ford envisioned turning the site into a veritable Lincoln museum.
The chair arrived at Greenfield Village in winter 1929 in a crate addressed: "Mr Henry Ford, Dearborn, Michigan." Grainy film footage taken during the unpacking shows two men removing wads of paper and padding to reveal the object, which was kept in the courthouse until about 1980, when it was moved into Henry Ford Museum.
With the opening of the "With Liberty & Justice for All" exhibit in 2006, the Lincoln chair joined an area devoted to exploring American freedom and social movements from the Revolutionary War to the civil rights era. Always encased in glass, it has retained the ability to make visitors stop, think and, sometimes, travel back 150 years in their imaginations.
"Once people realize it's real, it is this tangible piece of evidence from the past that reaches out and grabs you to that time and that person," said Braden. "If you just had a book or a picture or a label, it wouldn't have the power of the actual thing that he sat in."
On Wednesday, when the chair leaves its glass home and moves into the spotlight, it will be a reminder of what keeps Abraham Lincoln meaningful to generation after generation.
"One of the things that Lincoln once said was that what America stood for was the chance that anybody could rise to the level of their talent and ability," said Goodwin. "I think that's what we still hope."
