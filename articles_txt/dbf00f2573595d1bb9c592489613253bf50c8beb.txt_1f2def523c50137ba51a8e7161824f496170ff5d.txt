TAMPA, Fla. —  Henrik Lundqvist stared down elimination, again, on Tuesday. He made easy saves, lucky saves, spectacular saves. He made kick saves, diving saves, glove saves. He made one by catching a puck with the handle of his stick. He made another on a breakaway and was tackled by a charging Lightning forward. Lying on his back, disoriented, he looked up and reflexively stuck out his arm across the empty net to prevent a rebound.
Only the Rangers know how comforting it feels having Lundqvist in net when their season is on the brink, similar to the way a child feels clutching a favorite stuffed animal.
Lundqvist made 36 saves, thwarting the Lightning’s dynamic offense and leading the Rangers to a 7-3 win in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. Now, thanks to him, and Derick Brassard (hat trick), the Rangers will play Game 7 on Friday at Madison Square Garden.

“It’s really the best feeling,” Lundqvist said of playing another Game 7. “Even though it’s a lot of adrenaline and pressure and you’re nervous going into these games, you have to enjoy it. Everything is on the line again, playing in front of your fans. I’ve always said there’s no better feeling than to win a big game at home.”
His counterpart, Ben Bishop, was benched midway through the third period after he had allowed five goals.
The Rangers had started the day sounding hopeful. They had been in this situation together, trailing in a series, numerous times. They had their talking points and clichés down so well they may as well have read from scripts. They believed in Lundqvist. They had faith in one another. They had deconstructed the entire series into one convenient bite-size task: Win this game, and see what happens.
The Rangers had just overcome a three-games-to-one deficit in the previous series against the Washington Capitals. They had won 14 of their last 17 elimination games, including eight of nine under Coach Alain Vigneault. “A lot of it is just being in the right place mentally,” Lundqvist had said.
The Lightning started the game fast, as usual, but Lundqvist was equal to each challenge. He had to be to keep the Rangers’ season alive.
The Rangers survived the barrage, and Brassard opened the scoring at 3 minutes 36 seconds when he took a nifty pass from J. T. Miller and backhanded the puck past Bishop. Defenseman Keith Yandle made the score 2-0 when he flipped the puck from inside the blue line past a crowd of players and over Bishop’s arm at 15:30.
The Lightning closed within 2-1 on a power play when defenseman Anton Stralman made a crisp stretch pass from his own zone all the way to the Rangers’ blue line, splitting defensemen Ryan McDonagh and Dan Girardi, hitting Ryan Callahan in stride and creating a breakaway.
Callahan pulled the puck left and easily backhanded it around Lundqvist easily.
Still, after being outshot by 16-7, the Rangers were fortunate to lead after one period.
The Lightning had enough skill, from Steven Stamkos’s line to the Triplets line, to keep firing shots at Lundqvist. But the Rangers did their best to limit the damage, muscling the Lightning enough to slow their rushes and clearing out easy rebounds. Then if the Lightning ever managed to get a brief opening, Lundqvist was there, ready.

He paused for a moment, and his voice softened.
“Like I said, in this situation here, I just focus on my job.”
Lundqvist made 13 saves in the scoreless second period, as the Rangers tightened their defense, trying to protect the one-goal lead.
When the third period started, they attacked Bishop in waves, beating the Lightning to loose pucks and leaving them rattled along the boards. They exposed the young, 6-foot-7 Bishop for his cavalier positioning in the crease and penchant for letting rebounds bounce off his big body.
The Rangers scored three goals in a span of 4:12.
“The message after the second period, we had to keep forechecking and keep our legs moving,” Brassard said. “We wanted to make plays. We didn’t want to sit back against that team. We just went out there, we were pretty hungry on the forecheck and we got a big goal. That’s the way we need to play with the lead.”
Miller opened the barrage at 3:02, with assists from his linemates Brassard and Rick Nash. The fourth line made the score 4-1 on a goal by James Shepard at the six-minute mark. Brassard notched his second goal at 7:14, with assists from Miller and Nash. After Nikita Kucherov made it 5-2 at 7:50, Nash scored a power-play goal at 10:21. Kucherov scored his second at 13:21, and Brassard notched the hat trick with an empty-netter at 18:19 to close out the scoring.
“We showed a lot of character tonight,” Brassard said. “Henrik was really solid the first 10 minutes of the game, made some big saves for us. We had to step up. Our line was huge tonight. Miller really energized our line. Nash was a beast.”
When the buzzer sounded, Rangers fans, who had made their way down to first rows of the rink, erupted in celebration.
Now it is on to Game 7, the winner advancing to the Stanley Cup finals.
