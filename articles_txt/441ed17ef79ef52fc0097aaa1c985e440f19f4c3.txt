Detroit: Hyundai is the first carmaker to offer Google's Android Auto system.
Starting Tuesday, Android smartphone users with a 2015 Sonata can ask dealers to download the system for free.
Drivers must have a Sonata with navigation, which is part of an optional technology package. Android Auto will soon be available on other Hyundai models.
Android Auto connects to drivers' smartphones and lets them access certain apps, like Google Maps or Spotify, by voice, steering wheel controls or touchscreen graphics on the dashboard. It locks their phones while in use to help keep drivers' eyes on the road.
Google says Android Auto is expected to be offered on 28 different brands by the 2016 model year.
Hyundai says it expects to offer Apple's version of the system, CarPlay, sometime soon.
