CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - Gov. Brian Sandoval has approved a bill extending Nevadaâ€™s statute of limitations on sexual assault cases so victims have more time to report their experience and pursue criminal charges.
Sandoval signed AB212 on Tuesday surrounded by lawmakers and supporters. The bill raises the reporting deadline on sex assaults from four years to 20 years after the date of the alleged crime.
A Nevada woman who accused comedian Bill Cosby of sexually assaulted her decades ago testified in support of the bill in March.
Proponents of the bill said it would help sexual assault victims who sometimes take years to gather the courage to file a police report.
The bill unanimously passed both the Assembly and Senate.
