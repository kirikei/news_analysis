LAS VEGAS (AP) - Former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto says she will run for Harry Reid's Senate seat in 2016.
The Democrat made the announcement Wednesday. She says she left her new job as the executive vice chancellor for the Nevada System of Higher Education on Tuesday to launch her campaign.
The news comes less than two weeks after Reid announced he would not run for a sixth term. No Republicans yet have announced their intention to run.
Cortez Masto was elected attorney general in 2006 and served two terms but could not run again due to term limits. She was replaced by Republican Adam Laxalt.
She said her campaign will focus on the issues that defined her term as Nevada's top prosecutor, including protecting seniors, women and homeowners.
