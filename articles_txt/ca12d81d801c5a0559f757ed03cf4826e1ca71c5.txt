So what, precisely, has caught the interest of the Internet’s countless pundits and analysts? A question repeatedly asked, by writers of all political stripes, is whether or not Paul can hold on to the libertarian vote he inherited from his father.
Pointing to the longstanding tensions between the libertarian movement and the Republican Party, Jeet Heer predicts that Paul will end up losing that libertarian-activist base. In decades past, Heer recalls, libertarians were reticent to join up with the GOP, which they saw as part of the problem. Libertarians may be friendlier to the party today, but looking at history, Heer points out that “the Republicans who most closely echoed libertarian rhetoric often proved the biggest disappointment.”
For his part, David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institute, is enthusiastic about Paul’s candidacy, even if Paul isn’t the Platonic ideal of a libertarian. “No candidate seeking to put together a nationwide majority,” he points out, “is a perfect ideologue.”
Just as Ronald Reagan disappointed conservatives and Barack Obama has disappointed liberals, a hypothetical President Paul would surely disappoint libertarians. But, from Boaz’s point of view, that doesn’t make him a bad candidate. He observes that Paul “has a more libertarian policy agenda than any major candidate in memory” and expects that it “will garner him the lion’s share of his father’s supporters.”
FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten begs to differ . After looking at the polling data, he finds evidence that Rand is losing his father’s base in the key primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire and not making enough headway in the Republican mainstream to cover that loss. Citing a recent Iowa poll, Enten notes that Paul was only “the choice of about two-thirds of Ron Paul’s Iowa convention delegates.”
“That may seem like a lot, but if Paul wins only 70 percent of his father’s backers that puts him at 15 percent of the vote in Iowa,” says Enten. To make up the difference, Enten calculates that Paul would “need to build on his dad’s support by 10 percentage points from one of the  GOP’s other wings .”
At the New York Times’ data blog, the Upshot, Nate Cohn adds that self-professed libertarians are a small minority of the Republican electorate, making them a poor base from which to capture the party’s nomination. He goes so far as to argue “that the libertarian wing of the Republican Party barely exists at all,” and notes that “only 8 percent of self-identified Republican-leaners … take the libertarian position on four issues that [Paul] emphasizes: disapproval of the National Security Agency’s surveillance program; support for a more restrained American role in the world; skepticism of the efficacy of military intervention; and a relaxation on drug sentencing.”
Boaz  pushes back  on such assertions by digging up a 2014 Gallup poll that labeled 24 percent of respondents as libertarian. Reason editor-in-chief Nick Gillespie also contends that pollsters underestimate the actual number of libertarian and “libertarian-ish” voters in America, and that as far as the GOP is concerned, “there's simply no way a traditional social-con, big-defense politician is going to recapture younger voters now or in the future”.
One of the ways Paul has sought to expand his base beyond libertarians and build trust among mainstream conservatives is to backpedal on his anti-interventionist foreign policy views. The New Republic’s Danny Vinik suspects  that this attempt to square the circle will eventually fail. With his campaign barely begun, Paul is already being targeted on this issue by Republican hawks. To intervention skeptic Daniel Larison, this proves  that “there was never any use in trying to placate and win over hard-liners.”
Conservative commentator Ramesh Ponnuru  just doesn’t see  the Republican base coming around to Paul’s points of view on any number of subjects. Ponnuru remarks that, “on his signature issues, there are more Republicans who  actively oppose  his stances than actively support them” and that “Republicans don’t believe that they need to move in his direction on these issues to win elections.”
Even if Paul’s campaign gains traction, National Review’s Washington editor Eliana Johnson expects that the GOP establishment won’t have a hard time discrediting Paul. If and when he looks like a credible threat, Johnson argues, Paul’s competitors in the Republican field will make sure his kookiest, most controversial statements get plenty of airtime.
It’s not just conservatives who see his campaign as doomed, either. Writing at Salon, Jeff Stein also  downplays  Paul’s chances, not because his ideas are bad, but rather because the GOP isn’t interested in them. Peter Weber at The Week  thinks  Rand could cure what ails the GOP, if only it would have him. But on that question, Weber is decidedly pessimistic, given “the political culture of the Republican Party, which hasn’t shown much appetite to put new or untested faces on the top of its presidential tickets.”
But even if his campaign goes nowhere and everyone ends up disappointed with Rand Paul, the editors at Bloomberg View welcome  the Kentucky senator to the race as a badly needed shock to the system for the GOP, a role they very much hope he continues to play.
“The danger is that Paul’s ambition will constrain his usefulness,” they write. “Paul can do far more good stretching the Republican Party’s ideological straitjacket than he will ever do wearing it.”
