Wednesday 27 May 2015 4:46 p.m.
Activision and Sledgehammer Games have released details on the next lot of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare DLC, which will debut on June 2 for the Xbox One and Xbox 360.
Supremacy's four new multiplayer maps will include a revised version of the fan-favourite Highrise from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.
Descriptions of the new maps are as follows:
Parliament
Docked on the River Thames, this military cargo ship has a view of the London cityscape. Mixed sight-lines provide opportunities for all styles of play on the medium-sized map and there's a map-based scorestreak that unleashes a barrage of missiles.
Kremlin
Set outside Russia's presidential palace, this medium-sized, three-lane map forces players to navigate the worn-torn buildings of Red Square. Secure elevated positions can give a strategic advantage and there is a minefield that activates mid-match.
Compound
An Atlas training facility hidden away in the Colorado wilderness, this is a small, symmetrical map which funnels high-speed combat through tight corners to the main tower structures.
Skyrise
An Atlas Skyscraper overlooking the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, based on Highrise of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Gamers must dominate the power positions in the center of this small-to-medium sized map to control the key navigation points.
Supremacy also includes a new Exo Zombies episode, 'Carrier', in which the four heroes are trapped on an Atlas aircraft carrier. It features advanced new weaponry, enemy Atlas Strike teams, Sentinel support squads and a host of new zombie enemies.
Following the Xbox launch next week, Supremacy will release for PlayStation and PC players at a later date.
