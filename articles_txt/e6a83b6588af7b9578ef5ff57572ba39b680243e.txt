Senior staff from the House committee overseeing the Secret Service have asked the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General to look into allegations that U.S. Secret Service employees circulated private personnel information about Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is the Chairman  of the committee -- Chaffetz's staff told CNN on Friday.
Chaffetz's office also confirmed that he applied unsuccessfully to a job in 2003 with the Secret Service.
When asked about the allegations Secret Service Spokesperson Robert Hoback provided CNN with a statement from agency director Joe Clancy: "Any allegations concerning potential privacy violations will be thoroughly investigated. Any USSS personnel found to have violated privacy policies will be held accountable and face appropriate administrative action."
Hoback also said the Secret Service does not usually comment on specific internal policies and could not confirm that any policies have been violated.
CNN has learned that Clancy also sent a memo to staff Thursday reminding employees not to disclose personnel information.
"Disclosure of such information by employees is prohibited unless the employee to whom the information is being disclosed has a need for such record in the performance of the duties," Clancy wrote.
