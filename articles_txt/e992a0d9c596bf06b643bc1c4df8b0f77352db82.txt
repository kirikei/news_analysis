ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland lawmakers will be in session this weekend as the Legislature nears its scheduled adjournment.
Both the House of Delegates and the Senate will be meeting in Annapolis on Saturday.
They still have plenty of work to do before the session is scheduled to end on Monday at midnight.
The House is likely to take up a bill to end state-mandated stormwater management fees.
The Democratic-led Legislature is still hoping to reach an agreement with Republican Gov. Larry Hogan to approve restored funding to education and a 2 percent cost-of-living adjustment for state employees.
