BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP)- New estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau show Madison and St. Clair counties are shrinking in population.
The Belleville News-Democrat reports ( http://bit.ly/1CGjSrC ) that Madison County, where Edwardsville and Granite City are located, has lost more than 2,700 people. That’s measured from the April 2010 census through population estimates for 2014.
During the same period U.S. Census estimates show St. Clair County, where Belleville is located, lost more than 4,300 people.
St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark Kern said the board is working to draw employers to the region. He said it’s important to note that the numbers from the Census Bureau are estimates, not an actual count.
Census Bureau officials say they use birth and death certificates and addresses on tax returns to estimate annual population changes.
