AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Newly elected Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller created a $180,000-a-year job in his office for a political consultant who had previously donated $40,000 worth of services to the Republican during his campaign.
The Austin American-Statesman reports ( http://atxne.ws/1NYeoke ) that a second political consultant donated $76,000 worth of services before his wife was appointed to another position created by Miller, also with a $180,000 salary.
The first consultant, Walt Roberts , was named Miller's assistant agriculture commissioner for legislative affairs and external relations. The newspaper previously reported that he appears to have lobbied without registering.
Kellie Housewright-Smith , wife of the second consultant, Todd Smith , was dismissed after less than four months for improperly contacting state officials and missing work.
