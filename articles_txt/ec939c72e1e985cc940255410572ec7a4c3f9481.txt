After two months of discussion and debate, the city of Minneapolis will undergo a logo makeover: A logo featuring two sleek sailboats is out and a new logo featuring one sailboat is in.
"It's not often that a visual identity and standard graphics policy gets this much discussion or excitement," city coordinator Spencer Cronk said at a Minneapolis City Council committee meeting on Wednesday. 
On Friday, the full council voted in favor of the change in a logo that's been around for decades.
The logo debate raised some eyebrows regarding the amount of time it consumed. But Matt Laible, interim communications director, said it was a relatively inexpensive process. 
"The cost to the city to develop and design these new logos is limited to staff time, so that's good news," he said at Wednesday's committee meeting.
Minneapolis City Council member Elizabeth Glidden voted in favor of the change, but says "staff time" is not free.
"I know you said it's just city staff time and I always hate that when people say that because that's money," she said Wednesday. "That's your time that could otherwise be used on other things."
The new logo will be slowly phased in on letterheads, envelopes and business cards as they need to be replaced. It will be a longer time frame before the new logos appear on city vehicles, garbage cans and other items.
