Next year when you fill out your March Madness bracket, consult Mitt Romney first.
Why? Well the Huffington Post obtained a copy of Romney’s bracket  and the former presidential nominee is in the 99.98th percentile of ESPN’s Tournament Challenge. That’s the top 1% of brackets. That’s also better than President Barack Obama, who is in the 40th percentile.
He got six of eight Elite Eight teams correct, all Final Four teams right and predicted Monday night’s championship would be Wisconsin against Duke. He’s got the Blue Devils winning it all.
Say what you want about the man, Mitt’s bracket is so strong. pic.twitter.com/VUUSF6w7bO
