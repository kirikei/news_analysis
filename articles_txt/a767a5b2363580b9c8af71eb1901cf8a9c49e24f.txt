MANCHESTER, N.H., April 6 (Reuters) - A top aide to  Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire has  resigned following his arrest in a prostitution sting.
David Wihby, Ayotte's state director, was arrested at a  hotel in Nashua on Friday and charged with one misdemeanor count  of solicitation of prostitution.
Ayotte said she was "shocked and deeply saddened" by the  arrest of Wihby, whom she described as a longtime friend.
"David obviously cannot continue his duties, and I have  accepted his resignation," Ayotte said in a statement. "This is  a very difficult time, and my thoughts and prayers are with  everyone involved."
Ayotte, a former state attorney general, was elected to the  U.S. Senate in 2010. She is expected to face a tough 2016  reelection battle in a state where support tends to swing  between Republicans and Democrats.
Wihby, 62, is also a school board member in Manchester, the  largest city in New Hampshire. He had previously served as a  city alderman for 18 years.
Wihby is a close friend of Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas,  prominent Republican leader in the state.
"My heart is heavy," Gatsas said in a statement on Monday.  "David Wihby and I have been friends for almost 50 years. He has  dedicated much of his life to public service and done a lot of  good for a lot of people."
Wihby could not be reached for comment on Monday. He was  released on $2,000 bail and is due to be arraigned on May 11.     (Editing by Scott Malone and Lisa Lambert)
