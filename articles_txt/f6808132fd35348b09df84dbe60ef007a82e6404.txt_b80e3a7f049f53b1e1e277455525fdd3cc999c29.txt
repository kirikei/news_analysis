1. Warriors try to finish off Rockets, join Cavs in finals
The Golden State Warriors will try to wrap up their series against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, which would send them to Game 1 of the Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers on June 4. The Warriors currently lead the series 3-1, after the Rockets caught fire to avoid a sweep Monday. The Cavaliers sealed their trip to the Finals with a 118-88 rout to complete their sweep of the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference finals. This will be the Cavaliers first trip to the Finals since 2007, but it will also be LeBron James' fifth consecutive trip there, making him the first player to accomplish that feat with different teams.

2. Santorum poised to join 2016 field
Former senator and House member Rick Santorum is set to announce his candidacy at an event Wednesday in Butler County, Pa., near his boyhood home. Santorum, 57, mounted a surprisingly strong run in 2012 after languishing in polls for months leading up to the Iowa caucuses. He ultimately won in Iowa — belatedly, after Mitt Romney was initially declared the winner — and would go on to carry 10 additional states. Santorum will join a growing GOP field for 2016 that is likely to include more than a dozen candidates.

3. Iraqis to arm more Sunni fighters in battle to retake Ramadi
The U.S.-led coalition in Iraq confirmed that Iraqi security forces are engaged in an operation to retake Ramadi , with between 2,000 and 3,000 Iraqi army forces near the city, along with coalition air support. Ahmad al-Assadi, a spokesman for Iraq's Shiite militias said Ramadi, Anbar's provincial capital, is besieged from three sides by Iraqi forces with some 4,000 Sunni tribal fighters participating in the fight. Two officials from Anbar said the operation is focused on cutting off supply routes to the city first and that more Sunni fighters would be armed Wednesday to join the battle.
Iraq announced Tuesday it is renewing efforts to drive the Islamic State from western Anbar province. Without providing details, authorities said a new operation was being launched with Iraq troops supported by Shiite and Sunni forces. Wochit
4. Nebraska Senate could abolish death penalty with veto override
Gov. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., vetoed a bill Tuesday that would have abolished capital punishment in a traditionally conservative state for the first time in more than 40 years. The state Senate will try to override that veto Wednesday. Many senators argued that they oppose the death penalty for religious reasons. Others said it was too costly and inefficient, and questioned whether government could be trusted to manage it. Thirty senators are needed to override the veto, which is a realistic number since the measure initially passed 32-15. One senator has already publicly said he has changed his position, so Ricketts only needs to convince two more to do the same.

5. The Space Station's getting a bit of a makeover
NASA robotics officers on Wednesday morning plan to relocate an International Space Station storage module, the biggest change to the station's structure since its assembly was completed in 2011 . Teams in Houston will command the station's 58-foot, Canadian-built robotic arm to pull the Permanent Multi-purpose Module, or PMM, from the Unity node's Earth-facing port to the Tranquility node's forward port. It should take a few hours, with NASA TV coverage starting at 8 a.m.
The Canadarm 2 reaches out to capture the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft and prepare it to be pulled into its port on the International Space Station April 17, 2015.

CLEVELAND --  "A series isn't over until you end it," Lebron James said Sunday. On Tuesday, he ended the Conference Finals.
If there was one lesson to take from these brief, uncompetitive conference finals, it's that while the San Antonio Spurs' model of team ball was victorious last year, unless you have the talent and edge of those Spurs, one guy can still carry his team if he's spectacular and dominant. You know, like LeBron.
Tristan Thompson marveled at James ability to impart his will on the game after Game 3. Against the Hawks, James wasn't even his best self, struggling from the field on open shots. Yet with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving on the shelf for most of the series, James dominated through his passing, rebound, defense, and mentality. He attacked mismatches, found seams and mismatches, scored over, around, and through players that had no chance of containing him.
You can look at the metrics, break down the video, whatever you'd like. You couldn't watch the Eastern Conference Finals and not feel that James had really willed the team to victory. A young, inexperienced Cavaliers team that resembles the one that began the year in very few ways found its way to the Finals in large part because James molded it though leadership.
"Could I forsee this?" James asked himself on the podium Tuesday night. " At the beginning of the season, I couldn't. I couldn't forsee us being in the Finals at the beginning of the season because I just knew that we just had to get better and I just saw how young we were and how youngminded we were at that point in time. But I knew I had to lead these guys, and if they just followed my leadership, I knew I could get them to a place where they haven't been before."
On the surface, the Cavs seem to pose no threat to whoever comes out of the Western Conference (spoiler alert, it's going to be the Warriors). The Cavs got past the overwhelmingly disappointing East. Even against low expecatations, the Bulls and Hawks managed to play below them. But then, the Cavs weren't supposed to survive the Kevin Love injury, weren't supposed to get past the tougher and more experienced Bulls team, or the more freeflowing, precise Hawks team.
Hey, a year ago, the idea of LeBron James playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers seemed insane on its surface. Yet here we are. James came home, with all the challenges, and expectations, and somehow despite the circus still managed to exceed expecations, still faces the prospect of being an incredible underdog in the Finals, and somehow will still be held responsible if he can't win four more games.
"I'm a guy who believes in unfinished business," James said, "and I understood what these people were going through, the people here not only in Cleveland but in Northeast Ohio and all over the world who love and bleed wine and gold."
The King returned home and somehow dragged his kingdom to the summit. OK, not the summit, but like, really close. You can see it from there. Except there's a giant Western Conference fire-breathing dragon in the way.
That unfinished business has a few items left on the checklist, but after these conference finals, one thing is clear.
We still know who's the boss of the East.
LeBron James kicked back and advanced to the Finals Tuesday. (USATSI)
