WILKES-BARRE — More than 300 people gathered at Meyers High School on Sunday to celebrate Easter with dancing, drama, song and of course, preaching.
The congregation of Mount Zion Baptist Church held its fifth-annual holiday service at the high school as an opportunity to invite the entire community to gather, fellowship and worship.
The event theme — “Don’t just celebrate Easter, experience it!” — was evident as young members of the congregation dressed as biblical characters, made their way through the auditorium taking opportunity to greet visitors, providing information and encouragement.
Praise and worship leader Selena Montgomery said, “this is basically our way of bringing Easter to the entire community.”
Montgomery said the event and the church are known for “providing vibrant opportunities, a sense of belonging and pride in spiritual achievement.”
The service included the presentation of “The Thorn,” in which members presented the Easter message of the crucifixion and resurrection using music, drama, multimedia effects and message.
The service was preceded by a breakfast which community members seemed to enjoy as an opportunity to nourish both spirit and body.
“I think’s its really cool so many are people here and having fun,” said Ashley Conklin, enjoying scrambled eggs, grits and sausage.
David Nicholson, of Baltimore, Maryland, is a truck driver and calls Mount Zion his “home church.”
“I’ve been at Easter services here before, they’re inspirational and motivational, but without condemnation” said Nicholson, “and the pastor preaches truth.”
Pastor Michael Brewster emphasized the importance of informal fellowship and sense of community, in addition to formal worship.
As members and friends gathered, most knew each other by name, many gave a quick hug, all were smiling.
Attendees also received a small gift bag complete with candy and a small photo album, which brought smiles to many faces, especially those of the youngsters.
Brewster said initially the event was simply an opportunity to accommodate a larger number of people, but his vision for the event now includes, “a movement of positive change via partnerships with residents, businesses, non-profits and the Christian community.”
The church which a variety of ministries describes itself as today as “a multi-cultural family of believers from various denominational backgrounds and experiences,” and welcomes everyone.
