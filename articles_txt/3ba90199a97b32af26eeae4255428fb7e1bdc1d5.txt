Qunnipiac poll news release:
Support for medical marijuana is at 84 percent in Florida, according to the most current Q poll. Seventeen % of Florida voters say they &ldquodefinitely” or &ldquoprobably” would use pot, although 81 % say they &ldquoprobably” or &ldquodefinitely” would not.
Republican State Chief Monetary Officer Jeff Atwater is the strongest candidate in an early look at the 2016 U.S. Senate race in Florida, obtaining 38 % to 34 % for U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy. Atwater leads yet another attainable Democratic candidate, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, 42 – 32 %.
In other possible matchups:
* Murphy gets 35 % to 31 percent for Republican Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera
* Lopez-Cantera gets 33 percent to 32 % for Grayson.
The percentage of voters for every of these candidates who don&rsquot know adequate to form an opinion of them is 58 percent or higher.
Florida voters disapprove 49 – 42 percent of the job Gov. Rick Scott is performing, continuing a four-year streak of unfavorable ratings.
Voters approve 54 – 35 percent of the job U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio is doing and give U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson a 45 – 30 percent approval rating.
&ldquoIf U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio runs for president, the fight for his Senate seat will be a test of somewhat unknown candidates on both sides of the aisle,” Brown said. &ldquoFlorida&rsquos Chief Economic Officer Jeff Atwater has a modest edge in exposure to the voters, but we have a long way to go. Whoever wins will be the candidate who does the best job introducing themselves to the voters.”
