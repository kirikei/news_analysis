The next time a salesman at a car dealership offers to demonstrate a car's self-parking feature, you might want to step back—way back. A set of auto-parking features on the Volvo XC60 was being demonstrated to a crowd of eager observers, with dire consequences. The circumstances surrounding the video (embedded below) are still unclear. It appears that a car dealership was attempting to test the vehicle's driver assistance features for a crowd of spectators who mistakenly expected the car to come to a halt on its own.
It first appears as though the car encounters a glitch while trying to self-park. Actually, Volvo reports that the car dealer was attempting a demonstration of City Safety system in the Volvo XC60. On its own, the system lacks pedestrian detection. The ability to identify bystanders is available after an optional $3,000 upgrade.
Volvo spokesman, Stefan Elfström, attests that the car did not have the pedestrian detection feature. Furthermore, even if it did, the car should never be deliberately driven into a crowd. Elfström continues,
"In the video, the driver would anyway override any active safety system since he is actively accelerating towards to pedestrians...Volvo Cars strongly recommends never to perform any tests towards real humans, only dummies or similar objects should be used."
You're going to want to brace yourself before watching the auto-parking disaster for yourself. It starts off slowly, and ends with a bang. Thankfully, according to the video's author and Volvo, no one was seriously injured.
