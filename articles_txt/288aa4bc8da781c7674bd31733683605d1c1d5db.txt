Eugenie Bouchard was at a loss to explain her poor 2015 after a first-round exit at the French Open on Tuesday.
The Canadian, fresh from a standout 2014 that included semi-final runs at Melbourne Park and Roland Garros and finals appearance at Wimbledon, saw her slow year continue.
Bouchard made the quarter-finals at the Australian Open this year but has since won just three matches, including only one on clay.
The sixth seed suffered a 6-4 6-4 loss to Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic at the French Open, and was disappointed afterwards.
"I honestly don't know what to say," Bouchard said.
"I expected a good season, better than last year. This was the same as I have been feeling recently on court - just not like myself.
"I couldn't be as relaxed on court as I wanted to be."
Bouchard's last win was at the Internazionali d'Italia, where she eased past Zarina Diyas.
The 21-year-old said she would remain patient as she looks for a turnaround in fortunes heading into the grass-court season.
"I definitely felt a bit better in Rome," Bouchard said.
"That just makes it more disappointing to have a performance like today. It's unfortunate. But I'm sure one day it will stop.
"It's important to try to move on quickly. In tennis, every Monday is a new chance.
"At the same time, it's just a tennis match and I needn't worry too much. Everyone has highs and lows in their career. I have to be patient."
