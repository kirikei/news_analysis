ROBSTOWN, Texas
A former South Texas reserve deputy is accused of trying to smuggle several non-U.S. citizens into the country.
Federal court documents show Robstown police arrested Luis Enrique Guevara after authorities found three Guatemalan citizens inside the vehicle he was driving. Officers had pulled Guevara over for speeding and for having electronic devices on his dashboard that obstructed his view from the windshield.
Guevara is charged with alien smuggling. He was fired Friday from his position as a reserve deputy for the Cameron County Constable Precinct 1. He previously worked for the county sheriff's office as a reserve deputy in the early 2000s.
It wasn't immediately known if he has an attorney.
