WASHINGTON (AP) - An invitation to a White House state dinner has always been one of the most sought-after tickets in Washington. There's the exclusive venue, the highbrow company and a four-course meal served by America's most famous kitchen.
But it's become harder to land on the guest list. President Barack Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry S. Truman held office in the mid-1940s.
Obama has held seven dinners and plans two more this year: April 28 for Japan's leader and later on for China's president.
Truman held six dinners during nearly eight years in office.
