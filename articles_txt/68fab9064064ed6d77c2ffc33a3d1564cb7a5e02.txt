(AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear appeals from two men on Texas’ death row. Arthur Brown was convicted in the killings of six people back in June 1992. His attorneys asked the Supreme Court for $7,500 to help with his clemency petition. The justices on Monday refused to review the case, with no explanation. Evidence in his trial showed Brown was part of a drug ring between Texas and Alabama.
