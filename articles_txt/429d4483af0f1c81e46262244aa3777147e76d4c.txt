“Scrubs” stars Zach Braff and Donald Faison have committed to make pizza available at same-sex weddings in Indiana, even if that means that they have to make it themselves.
Braff tweeted on Friday "If you really and truly want pizza for your gay wedding in Indiana…we will make it for you."
He attached a photo to the tweet of himself and co-star Faison.
This tweet comes on the heels of other celebrities, including Miley Cyrus and Ashton Kutcher, taking to social media to condemn a controversial Indiana law that they fear would allow businesses to discriminate against gay customers.
