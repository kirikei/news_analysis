OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Oklahoma lawmakers have approved a ban on a common second-trimester abortion procedure that critics describe as dismembering a fetus.
The Senate voted 37-4 Wednesday for the bill by Tulsa Republican Rep. Pam Peterson. It now goes to Republican Gov. Mary Fallin, who has previously signed several anti-abortion bills.
Under the bill, doctors cannot use forceps, clamps, scissors or similar instruments on a live fetus to remove it from the womb in pieces. Such instruments are used in dilation and evacuation procedures performed in the second trimester.
The bill would ban the procedure except when necessary to save a woman's life or a serious health risk to the mother
A similar measure was signed into law in Kansas on Wednesday.
