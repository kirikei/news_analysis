Emanuel, Lewis Speak For The First Time In Years In Post-Election Call
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis spoke via phone  this week following Tuesday's mayoral runoff election.
Emanuel reportedly called Lewis post-election in an effort to ease tensions between them. It was the first time the two foes have spoken since Emanuel allegedly hurled a " F-- you, Lewis" at the labor leader during a 2011 exchange about implementing a longer school day.
Lewis was pondering a mayoral bid to take on Emanuel before she fell ill and opted against a run. CTU backed Emanuel's mayoral runoff opponent Jesus "Chuy" Garcia.
"I'm all for trying to reset the button because I don't think Rahm Emanuel and me not talking is productive," Lewis told the Chicago Sun-Times on Thursday.
Asked about the call, an unnamed mayoral aide told the newspaper, "The mayor thought they had a very good conversation and both were honest in their desire to start fresh after the last four years."
"The challenges they face in getting Springfield to act require that they work together," the mayoral aide added. "The election was a good opportunity to hit the reset button."
