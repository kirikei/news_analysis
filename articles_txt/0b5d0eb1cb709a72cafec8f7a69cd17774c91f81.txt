The balance amongst religious freedom and gay and transgender rights has dominated the headlines as lawmakers in Arkansas and Indiana passed bills that some said gave folks of faith license to discriminate.
The rancorous uproar that followed — rallies, criticisms from corporate giants Apple, Eli Lilly and Wal-Mart, along with an avalanche of scoldings from both conservatives and gay activists — left each states feeling bruised and scrambling to rewrite their legislation.
It really is a far cry from the scene that played out in Utah last month, when lawmakers, Mormon church authorities and leaders of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community have been celebrated for passing SB296, a law which marries nondiscrimination protections for the LGBT neighborhood with safeguards for religious organizations and their affiliates.
So what's various?
"The simple answer is that Utah did not pass a RFRA," said Troy Williams, executive director of Equality Utah. "Utah passed a law that protects people today of faith and gay and transgender Utahns from discrimination in housing and employment. That is quite distinct."
RFRA is short for Religious Freedom Restoration Act, legislation which is made to guarantee that religious-liberty interests are protected. A federal RFRA, pronounced "riff-ruh," cleared Congress in 1993. It demands government to accommodate an individual's religious beliefs, unless there is a compelling interest at stake.
Beneath a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the law can't be applied to states, so, in 1999, states began adopting their personal RFRA laws. To date, 21 states have enacted RFRAs, like Indiana and Arkansas.
As they have most usually been made use of, RFRAs can provide critical protections for people today of faith, mentioned Marina Lowe, legislative and policy counsel for Utah's American Civil Liberties Union chapter.  A Muslim denied the suitable to wear a headscarf, for example, would be shielded below a RFRA and would have grounds to sue.
"It is this thought that the government can't burden your potential to practice your religion, or should not, unless there is a compelling interest," Lowe stated. "Public security, for example, might be a compelling interest."
Utah has no RFRA law on the books, but may possibly have if state lawmakers had passed HB322, a proposal from Rep. LaVar Christensen, R-Draper, which sought to grant wide protections for religious conscience and would have allowed folks to use religious freedom as a defense in discrimination lawsuits.
Residence lawmakers passed the bill, but it failed in the Senate in the final hours of the legislative session.
HB322's intent mirrored the present national trend to extend RFRA safeguards to private men and women, Lowe said. Its protections had been potentially so broad that Lowe called it "worse than Indiana's" original proposal.
"When a religious-freedom law starts being utilised almost as a sword to go against somebody's civil rights," Lowe said, "that is when we have a dilemma."
On Thursday, Indiana and Arkansas passed retooled versions of their respective RFRA proposals, The Linked Press reported.
Arkansas' revised measure resembles the federal RFRA and addresses actions only by the government, not these of folks or businesses.
Indiana's revised measure prohibits enterprises or service providers from working with the law as a defense for refusing goods or solutions. It also bars discrimination primarily based on a number of classifications, like race, colour, religion, ancestry age, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity.
The Indiana law exempts churches, affiliated religious schools and nonprofit religious organizations from its rules, the AP reported.
Utah's SB296 has unique and a lot more specific goals than the laws passed by Arkansas and Indiana, despite the fact that it also makes concessions to religious organizations.
