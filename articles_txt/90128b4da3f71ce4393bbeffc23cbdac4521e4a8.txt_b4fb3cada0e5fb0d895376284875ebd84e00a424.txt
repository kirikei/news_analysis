Mike Pelfrey leads Twins past Red Sox 2-1

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When Mike Pelfrey saw activity in the Minnesota Twins' bullpen during the fifth inning, he knew it was time to bear down.
Pelfrey was sharp for seven innings, Trevor Plouffe and Kurt Suzuki hit back-to-back RBI doubles in the first, and the Twins held on to beat the Boston Red Sox 2-1 on Tuesday night.
After rain delayed the game's first pitch for 1 hour, 21 minutes, Minnesota jumped on Clay Buchholz (2-6) for three doubles and two runs in the first.
That was enough support for Pelfrey (4-1), who retired the last seven batters he faced and lowered his ERA to 2.77. Pelfrey allowed five hits and struck out four to reward manager Paul Molitor for sticking with him.
"I don't think anybody likes seeing the bullpen going, especially not in the fifth," Pelfrey said. "But it worked out."
Glen Perkins got Hanley Ramirez to fly out to right field with the bases loaded to end the eighth.
"It got a little dicey there," Molitor said.
The All-Star left-hander stayed in and worked a perfect ninth for his 17th save in as many chances.
Mike Napoli's single in the second scored David Ortiz for Boston's lone run. The Red Sox have scored 14 runs in their last eight road games.
"I would like to think our approach can be a little more concerted, a little bit more concentrated," Boston manager John Farrell said. "You never want to take away credit from a guy who has thrown the ball well this year in Pelfrey, but still I think we're capable of more than what we showed here tonight."
After Pelfrey struck out Ramirez in the fourth, Ramirez whacked the bench in the dugout with his bat. In the sixth, half of Ramirez's bat went flying into the stands after it broke on a soft liner to shortstop.
Buchholz settled down after the first and lasted 7 1-3 innings to notch Boston's 10th quality start in 13 games.
The Twins have won 18 of their last 24 games and 11 of 13 at home. Their 17 wins in May are the most in the American League and most for the month of May since they won 16 in 2011.
After injuries and ineffectiveness nearly cost Pelfrey a spot in the rotation out of spring training, the right-hander has been a big part of Minnesota's turnaround. Tuesday's start showed that Pelfrey, like the Twins, can pull through, even if things aren't going his way early.
"Like a lot of guys have been doing in that rotation, they find another gear," Molitor said.
ORTIZ DROPPED TO 5TH
Ortiz doubled in the first to end an 0-for-16 slump. Farrell dropped Ortiz to fifth in the batter order, the lowest spot in the lineup he's hit since May 6, 2012. Ramirez was moved up to the fourth spot and Pablo Sandoval hit third.
"Those guys have every ability to be an elite three guys in the lineup, and we're trying to gain a little bit more production and consistency," Farrell said.
FORE!
With the 2016 Ryder Cup being held at Hazeltine National Golf Club, the Ryder Cup trophy was on display inside the Twins' clubhouse before the game. Several players, including 1B Joe Mauer, took pictures with it.
CF Aaron Hicks, a top amateur golfer in California before picking baseball, was a little more hesitant, choosing instead to admire the trophy from a distance.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Twins: In his second rehab outing at Class AAA Rochester as he recovers from a shoulder injury, reliever Casey Fien needed just 10 pitches to get through a scoreless inning.
UP NEXT
Both teams will be back on the field at noon on Wednesday to wrap up the three-game series. Twins RHP Phil Hughes (3-4, 4.50) will be trying for his third straight quality start. RHP Rick Porcello (4-3, 5.07) goes for Boston and is 5-1 with a 2.96 ERA in his last eight starts at Minnesota.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Another lineup change didn't make much of a difference for the ailing Boston Red Sox as the plate struggles continued for the team getting paid Major League Baseball's fourth-most expensive payroll. After Tuesday's 2-1 loss in Minnesota, the Red Sox rank in the bottom third of all teams in runs, hits and batting average two months into the season.
Something's not adding up, no matter how many lineup changes manager John Farrell has made.
"We got to keep putting ourselves in positions to score," Second baseman Dustin Pedroia said. "We keep saying that, but it seems like we're one swing away every game and that swing is coming."
That swing came off switch-hitting Pablo Sandoval , who was bumped up to the No. 3 spot in another lineup change, as he ripped a shot toward center off Twins' left-handed closer Glen Perkins in the eighth inning. However, second baseman Brian Dozier stopped the ground ball from reaching the outfield and held Sandoval at first to load the bases.
The Red Sox needed one more swing and didn't get it. Down 2-1 with two outs in the eighth, Hanley Ramirez left all three Sox on base as he came up empty for the fourth-straight at-bat. Ramirez is now 4-for-26 in his last seven games. Seeking a spark, Farrell swapped Sandoval and David Ortiz in the No. 3 and No. 5 slots in the lineup. The move produced only one hit from each batter.
"I would like to think our approach can be a little more concerted," Farrell said. "A little bit more concentrated."
Failure at the plate spoiled Clay Buchholz 's strong outing on Tuesday night. Buchholz bounced back from a rough first inning that saw three doubles by allowing just four hits in the next 6 1/3 innings. Though Buchholz has posted a 2.03 ERA in his last three starts, the Red Sox put up just one run in each game, all losses that push the pitcher's season record down to 2-6.
Boston has scored just two runs or fewer in nine of the last 14 games.
"It seems like we're running into a lot of guys that are throwing the ball well right now," Buchholz said.
That was the case with Twins' right-hander Mike Pelfrey (4-1), who mowed down nine-straight Sox batters before Pedroia's single to center started the comeback attempt in the eighth inning.
"You never want to take credit from a guy who has thrown the ball well this year in Pelfrey," Farrell said. "But still, I think we're capable of more than what we showed tonight.
"I’m not going to say we expanded the strike zone, but we hit a lot of pitchers’ pitches tonight.”
After Twins' starter Ricky Nolasco retired 15-straight Red Sox batters in Monday's 7-2 loss, Pelfrey breezed through 14 of 17 hitters in the middle of Tuesday's game and finished with just one earned run for the first time in May.
Moved down to the five spot, Ortiz ended his three-game hitless streak with a centerfield double to the warning track in his first plate appearance. He put a good swing on a deep fly ball to left field and grounded out the next two at-bats to finish 1-for-4 on the night. Following a seven-game hitting streak, shortstop Xander Bogaerts is 0-for-8 in back-to-back losses to the Twins.
"I think everybody is scratching their heads a little bit," Buchholz said. "But I don't think it brings any form of doubt into anybody's mind about what we think this team can do."
