For the first time ever, the Humble Bundle has come to consoles. The Humble Nindie Bundle focuses on indie games available on Nintendo platforms. You can pay what you want for Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition on the Wii U, and the 3DS games Woah Dave! and Mighty Switch Force! Beating the average of about $9 gets you The Fall and OlliOlli on the Wii U (and 3DS for OlliOlli), as well as Moon Chronicles Episode 1 on the 3DS and any extra games.
However, for $10, you’ll not only beat the average, but also get Stealth Inc 2 and SteamWorld Dig on both the Wii U and 3DS. This is an amazing deal, and hopefully ushers in a new era of console-centric indie bundles.  With only a $1 price difference, anyone with an interest in anything above the free tier might as well check out everything this bundle has to offer.
