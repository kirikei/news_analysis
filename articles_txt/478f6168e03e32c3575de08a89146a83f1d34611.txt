LITTLE ROCK, Ark. –  Just days after becoming the world's oldest documented person, 116-year-old Gertrude Weaver has died in Arkansas.

Weaver became the oldest person in the world after the death of a 117-year-old Japanese woman last week, according to records kept by the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group. Weaver was born on July 4, 1898.
Weaver told reporters last week that the key to her longevity was being kind to everyone and eating her own cooking.
She also said she hoped President Barack Obama would come to her 117th birthday party in July.
