China on Tuesday outlined a first ever "white paper" on military strategy that outlined a more robust posture for its blue-water navy, and warned of threats to its security from "still smouldering" boundary disputes over land.
The white paper, released in Beijing by the State Council, or Cabinet, Information Office, is the first ever dedicated to China's military strategy, and the ninth defence paper issued by the People's Liberation Army.
The paper said the PLA Navy "will gradually shift its focus from a sole strategy of "offshore waters defence" to a combined one of "offshore waters defence and open seas protection," suggesting a more outward-focused and robust military strategy. The white paper warned that "certain disputes over land territory are still smouldering". With China only having unresolved land boundaries with India and Bhutan, the statement is a likely reference to the boundary dispute with India.
