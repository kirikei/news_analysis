GOP nonetheless has hopes to win Michigan in 2016
In addition to gauging enthusiasm and support in the state, candidates also are seeking to firm up economic support amongst the state's generous political donors, as well as doable staffers to enable run their campaigns in Michigan. Paul has already hired Grand Rapids political consultant John Yob to help  his campaign, while former state Republican Celebration chairman Saul Anuzis has been vocally backing Cruz.
"In the common election, Michigan is going to be a serious battleground state. But in the primary it really is going to be really competitive," mentioned Republican political consultant Stu Sandler. "And from a donor aspect, there is a lot of dollars to be raised here."
Indeed, Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential candidate and Michigan native son, raised $9.1 million from Michigan residents throughout the last presidential election cycle, far exceeding the $five.7 million provided to President Barack Obama by Michiganders for his re-election efforts.
Welday predicted Michigan voters will see a great deal a lot more of the candidates prior to the March 8 main than ahead of the November election.
Michigan has not voted for a Republican for president since 1988 when George  Bush handily beat Democrat Michael Dukakis, ahead of losing a re-election bid to Bill Clinton in 1992.
In the 2012 election, Romney  came to Michigan only after soon after winning the state's main, and Obama came to Michigan only once in the course of the complete campaign season in 2012.
"You are going to be really hard-pressed to see candidates commit a entire lot of time in Michigan for the 2016 fall election," Welday said. "Due to the fact Michigan has not gone Republican given that 1988, it will be second-tier if you happen to be a Republican.
"Candidates are not seeking to the fall campaign now, but how are they going to get a share of Michigan's delegates in the principal."
