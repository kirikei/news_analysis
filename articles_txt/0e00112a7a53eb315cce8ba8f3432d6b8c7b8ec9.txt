Donations pour in to GoFundMe page started after Indiana pizzeria owner's interview on Glenn Beck's network
Hundreds of thousands of dollars donated to pizza shop that "would have to say no" to catering a gay wedding

Most viewers of that interview are now seeing it on a GoFundMe page launched by a reporter and activist named Lawrence Billy Jones III. He had started working as a contributor to The Blaze four days earlier, after a short but fruitful career as a black conservative online pundit.
The initial goal for the campaign was $25,000. By noon Friday, more than $645,000 had been kicked in. That's more than enough to buy a large home in Walkerton.
"Our goal was simply to help take one thing off this family's plate as the strangers sought to destroy them," Jones wrote. "But other strangers came to the rescue and the total just keeps going up."
Memories Pizza had quickly become a mom-and-pop version of Chick-fil-A, the national fried chicken sandwich chain that faced opprobrium for its owners' criticism of gay marriage and immediately became a conservative cause celebre.
