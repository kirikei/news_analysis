Verlander threw 70 pitches over 4 1/3 innings in a simulated game at the O.co Coliseum before the Tigers' 1-0 victory against the Oakland Athletics. He struck out eight and allowed three hits, facing Tigers outfielder Tyler Collins, catcher Bryan Holaday and infielders Dixon Machado and Hernan Perez.
"It went really well," said Verlander, who has spent all season on the disabled list. "The most important thing was I felt really good. Stuff was good. It got better as I went along, which I probably would expect from not being on the mound for a while. All in all, very pleased."
Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said Verlander looked "real good" during the simulated game.
"If he does feel all right (Wednesday), I'd imagine a rehab start would be the next step," Ausmus said.
That minor league appearance could come as early as Sunday.
Verlander said he threw all his pitches and didn't hold back on any of them, including his curveball and slider, which he has tweaked during his recovery.
"I've had time to think about things and really worked on my slider, kind of changed the way I throw it a little bit and have been pretty pleased in the bullpens with it," Verlander said. "Obviously, it's hard to tell until you get guys in the batter's box and see their reactions, but I was really pleased with it today. More of a true slider. A little bit better than what I've been throwing in the past."
Verlander said that, barring a setback, one rehab start of around 85 pitches should be all he would need before being activated. His fastball definitely looked ready Tuesday for a major league game.
"I could tell it was coming out pretty good," Verlander said. "I think the guys' swings will tell you what you need to know, and nobody really put a really good swing on a fastball. And a lot of guys were a little late on it."
