Tech blog spinoff Re/code is acquired by online media chain
The Associated Press
Tech news blog Re/code said Tuesday it's been acquired by online publishing company Vox Media, just 18 months after spinning off from its former parent, The Wall Street Journal.
Vox operates several news and entertainment sites, including The Verge, which also covers tech news. In an online statement, Re/code founders Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg said they will continue to operate their site separately but may occasionally collaborate with The Verge.
Re/code has focused on tech companies and business news, while The Verge reports from a culture and lifestyle perspective.
Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
Swisher and Mossberg started their blog at The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corp., where it was known as AllThingsD. Since the spinoff, Re/code has continued to stage successful industry conferences and earned a reputation for breaking exclusive stories. But its readership has lagged.
Re/code had 1.5 million unique visitors in April, compared with 12 million for the Verge and 53 million for all Vox sites combined, according to the comScore research service.
Another tech news site, GigaOm, shut down earlier this year. A number of other news sites continue to cover the tech industry in New York and Silicon Valley, and some have added staff in recent months.
