ALABAMA (WAFF) - House Democrats presented their agenda for the rest of this session on Wednesday, and it includes several bills that would normally be dead on arrival.
"It may depend on how desperate the State is for tax dollars," said WAFF political analyst Dr. Waymon Burke.
Dr. Burke believes for the first time in a while, Republicans may be forced to consider ideas from Democrats, starting with sin taxes.
Two bills we could see unity on, both deal with the lottery. House Democrats say their lottery bills would generate $280 million for the state, and they want to give Alabamians the final say.
"Polling numbers show over 70% of the people in Alabama want the opportunity to vote on lottery. So, why would you deny the best form of democracy to the people?" said House Minority Leader Craig Ford.
He's confident that this could be the session that lotto gets the green light, and says several Republicans have told him, "That they were going to support this bill, that they just don't want to sponsor it."
