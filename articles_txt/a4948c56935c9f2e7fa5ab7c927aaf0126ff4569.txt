ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) He just won re-election but New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is already looking ahead to a possible third term. 
New York Board of Elections records show Cuomo's campaign committee has changed its name to ``Andrew Cuomo 2018.'' 
A spokesman for the Democrat's campaign declined to comment Monday on the new name. The change was first reported by the Daily News, which also reported that Cuomo is holding a $15,000-a-person fundraiser in New York City on Tuesday. 
Cuomo was re-elected in November and hasn't said whether he wants a third term. Until recently, he was widely believed to be considering a presidential run in 2016. 
Larry Schwartz, a former top Cuomo aide who left the administration this year, said in a statement that he would ``bet anything'' that Cuomo runs again.
