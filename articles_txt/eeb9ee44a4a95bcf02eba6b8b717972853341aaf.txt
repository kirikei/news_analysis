Indiana Gov. Mike Pence urged lawmakers Tuesday to send a bill to his desk by the end of the week to clarify the intent of a new law that critics fear could permit discrimination against gays and lesbians.

WHAT THE LAWS SAY
The Indiana law, which takes effect July 1, does not specifically mention gays and lesbians, but opponents say it is designed to protect businesses and individuals who do not want to serve gays and lesbians, such as florists or caterers who might be hired for a same-sex wedding.
The law prohibits state laws that "substantially burden" a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs unless the government can show that it has a compelling interest and that the action is the least restrictive means of achieving it. The definition of "person" includes religious institutions, businesses and associations.
Critics say that language is broader than a 1993 federal law signed by then-President Bill Clinton that Pence says it's based on.
Twenty states now have similar laws in place.
Indiana University law professor Deborah Widiss says such laws across the country have not "been a sort of blank check to discriminate."

CHANGES COMING
Pence said Tuesday he stands by the law but acknowledged that Indiana has a "perception problem." He said he has been meeting with lawmakers and business leaders "around the clock" to address concerns that the Indiana bill would allow discrimination against gays and lesbians.
The governor called for legislation addressing those issues by the end of the week, and Republican leaders said they were working on language.

REACTIONS POUR IN
NASCAR issued a statement Tuesday saying it was "disappointed" by the legislation, becoming the latest organization or business to speak out against it. The NCAA, which has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1999, says it is concerned about the law's effect on future Indiana events.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday announced a ban on non-essential state-funded travel to Indiana because of the law. Connecticut made a similar move a day earlier.

POLITICIANS WEIGH IN
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates have jumped to the defense of Pence and Indiana's law. Bush said the law was "simply allowing people of faith space to be able to express their beliefs" and compared the measure to one in Florida.
