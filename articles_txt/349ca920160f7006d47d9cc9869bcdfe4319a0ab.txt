Harry Reid, NH Democrats sign onto populist petition
U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and about 160 New Hampshire Democrats and activists have now signed onto a petition urging Democratic presidential hopefuls to run on "big, bold, economic-populist ideas."
The Granite Staters on the list include former U.S. Reps. Carol Shea-Porter and Paul Hodes, state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark of Portsmouth, state Sen. David Watters of Dover, and former state Sen. Burt Cohen of New Castle.
The " Ready for Boldness " petition is organized by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Its mission is to urge Hillary Clinton and other possible Democratic presidential hopefuls to support "debt-free college," expanding Social Security benefits, Wall Street reform, campaign finance reform, and higher wages.
The latest New Hampshire names on the list includes Larry Drake, chairman of the Portsmouth Democratic City Committee, Dean Barker of Blue Hampshire, former NH Freedom to Marry Executive Director Mo Baxley, former NH NEA President Karen McDonough, state Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, activist Mary Rauh of New Castle, and state Rep. Laura Pantelakos, D-Portsmouth.
