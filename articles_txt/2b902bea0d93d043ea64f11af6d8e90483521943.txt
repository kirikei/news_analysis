BALTIMORE — A day after Baltimore beat Houston in the series opener thanks to a pair of two-run homers, the Orioles’ bats went back to struggling in a 4-1 loss to the Astros on Tuesday night at Camden Yards.
The Orioles (20-23) have scored two runs or fewer in three of their past four and have plated just seven runs over their last 40 innings.
On Tuesday, the Orioles put a runner on base in each of their first seven innings but could only score one run. The Orioles let Scott Feldman (4-4), an ex-Baltimore pitcher, off the hook early, hitting into double plays in each of the first three innings.
Orioles starter Chris Tillman (2-6) danced on a tightrope through six scoreless innings before allowing a pair of two-out, run-scoring hits in the seventh.
