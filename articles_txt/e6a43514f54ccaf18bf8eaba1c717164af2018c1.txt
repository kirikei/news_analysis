LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson says he doesn't see an urgent need for an executive order extending anti-discrimination workplace protections to gay and lesbian state employees after lawmakers approved a reworked religious objections bill.
Hutchinson told reporters Thursday he had considered such an order as an alternative in case lawmakers didn't agree to his request to revise the religion bill after it faced widespread criticism that it was anti-gay. The Republican governor last week signed the compromise measure, which supporters say addresses discrimination concerns by more closely mirroring a 1993 federal law.
Gay rights advocates on called on Hutchinson to follow through and issue an executive order.
