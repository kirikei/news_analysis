Gov. Jay Inslee announcing today he's rescinded the ban on state-funded travel to Indiana.
This morning, he issued the following notice to his cabinet agencies:
As noted in the memo, “Governor Mike Pence signed legislation  amending the law and remedying the most egregious elements of the law. The new  amendment prohibits businesses and individuals from refusing service or goods to  potential clients based on that client’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or  other characteristics. This is a promising step toward greater cultural  inclusion and acceptance for LGBT communities.”
Here is the complete memo from Governor Inslee:
Earlier this week, after the state of Indiana passed its Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), IC 34-13-9, I ordered executive-level agencies and small cabinet agencies to prohibit publicly funded non-essential travel to Indiana. I issued my order because Indiana's RFRA opened the door to allowing private companies to discriminate against individuals in that state, in sharp contrast to our own state's long commitment to diversity and inclusion. My order stated that the travel ban would remain in effect so long as Indiana's law existed in its original form.
In response to the intense public criticism stemming from the passage of Indiana's RFRA, the Indiana Legislature moved quickly to fix the law. Yesterday, Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed legislation amending the law and remedying the most egregious elements of the law. The new amendment prohibits businesses and individuals from refusing service or goods to potential clients based on that client's sexual orientation, gender identity, or other characteristics. This is a promising step toward greater cultural inclusion and acceptance for LGBT communities. Accordingly, I am lifting the ban on publicly funded non-essential travel to Indiana.
