ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — The charter school measure proposed by Gov. Larry Hogan is heading to the Maryland House of Delegates for approval.
On Friday the House Ways and Means Committee voted to give the amended bill a favorable report, clearing the way for the governor's initiative to be voted on by the full chamber.
The bill was dramatically amended from its original form by a Senate committee , but only a few additional amendments were added in the House.
One amendment that was accepted explicitly states a decision by a local chartering authority regarding a weighted lottery and geographic attendance area cannot be appealed to the state.
Another change pushes back the final report of a school funding study by about one year.
Hogan recently said he was unhappy with the changes.
