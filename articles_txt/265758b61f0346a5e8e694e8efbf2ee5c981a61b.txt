NASHVILLE — Filing out of a ballroom after four hours of speeches by a dozen GOP hopefuls, National Rifle Association member Terry Brown said she was impressed by many of the speakers — but was far from making up her mind about which potential candidate she might back in the next presidential election .
"I liked (Florida Sen. Marco) Rubio, but then again I've got to read up a lot more on how they stand on all the issues," said Brown, a 64-year-old office manager from Stafford, Va. "It's the first time I've ever heard some of them talk. I've got to hear more than the Second Amendment, because the next president is going to have to deal with so much more."
More than 3,000 NRA members on Friday heard from a slate of the Republican Party's most likely candidates at the NRA's annual meeting at Music City Center in Nashville.
At 10-minutes a speech, attendees heard abbreviated stump speeches from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Dr. Ben Carson, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., and billionaire businessman Donald Trump, among others.
"It's a strong bunch," said Ron McDow, a retired Nashville physician and lifelong NRA member. "Marco Rubio was very polished and informative. Gov. Perry was strong. Rick Santorum was very heartfelt. But it's still early and I'm not committing to anything at this point. This just helps me understand a person's character."
No strong consensus emerged about the Republican speakers.
"I liked them all, but they were all pretty similar," said Neal Dwelley, a 50-year-old aircraft mechanic from South Berwick, Maine. "My main concern is having a strong leader, someone who can defend the border. The Second Amendment is just one little part of that."
But his wife, Christine Dwelley, said she was most impressed by Cruz.
"I love him (Cruz)," said Dwelley, a 48-year-old registered nurse. Dwelley has two children in the military — a daughter in the Air Force and a son in the National Guard. "He's done a lot to keep Second Amendment rights for us. I believe he would be the strong leader that we, and our military, need."

Glenn Morrow, 67, a lifelong NRA member, walked out before the last speaker, Ted Cruz, had finished. He had brought his 8-year-old son to the annual meeting and the boy was ready to go look at guns, his father said.
Morrow said he had wanted to hear more specifics from the speakers, but left disappointed.
"They were very good at saying what we wanted to hear, but really not strong on details," said Morrow, a registered dietitian. "They're talking about what's wrong with government, but not talking about what they were doing to fix it."
If Morrow was impressed by anyone, it was Carson, a retired neurosurgeon whose speech at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast brought him to the attention of conservatives. Carson is exploring a candidacy.
"Ben Carson doesn't have the drama or the finger-pointing of Rick Perry," Carson said. "He's not a politician. He's one of us."
Coleen Choate, a 10-year NRA member who works as a technician at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, described herself as real conservative.
"I liked Marco Rubio," she said. "I just liked the way he put things. I'm a real conservative. I got to see a little bit about each one, but I need to know a whole lot more before I know which one really shares my values."
