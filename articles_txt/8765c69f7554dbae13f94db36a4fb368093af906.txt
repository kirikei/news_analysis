BOSTON — Gov. Charlie Baker has named the former head of the Boston Bar Association to chair his Judicial Nominating Commission, a panel that screens applicants for judgeships.
The 21-member panel also includes J.W. Carney, a prominent defense attorney who served as the lead court-appointed lawyer for James "Whitey" Bulger during the Boston gangster's 2013 trial.
Baker, who has yet to make any judicial nominations, announced the makeup of the commission on Friday.
Paul Dacier, general counsel for EMC Corp. and immediate past president of the bar association, is the chair. He was also a member of the nominating commission under former Gov. Mitt Romney .
The group's first major task will be reviewing applicants and making recommendations to Baker on a successor to retiring state Appeals Court chief justice Phillip Rapoza.
