Rep. Bill Foster won't run for U.S. Senate, backs Duckworth
Rep. Bill Foster of Naperville on Friday took himself out of the running for next year’s Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate and endorsed Rep. Tammy Duckworth ’s bid to take on Republican Sen. Mark Kirk .
Foster, serving his second straight term in Congress from the southwest suburban 11th District after an earlier stint in the House, said he would instead become a co-chair of Duckworth’s finance committee for Senate.
“After careful thought and consideration, I have decided to avoid what would be a costly and, ultimately unnecessary, primary,” Foster said in a statement.
“Millions upon millions of special interest dollars will flood our state in support of Mark Kirk. The resources on the Democratic side should be focused on winning that seat back for the people of Illinois, not on Democrats fighting one another,” Foster said.
Foster, a wealthy scientist and businessman, had been viewed by some Democrats as a candidate who could self-fund a sizable portion of a Senate campaign.
Duckworth, of Hoffman Estates, is serving her second term in the House from the northwest and west suburban 8th District. She announced her candidacy for the Senate nomination in late March.
Another Democratic congresswoman, Rep. Robin Kelly of Matteson, has also been considering a bid for the primary nomination but hasn’t announced a decision.
