SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP)  TiVo Inc. attracted another 285,000 subscribers to its digital video recording technology during its fiscal first quarter, helping propel the company to a performance that exceeded analysts' projections.
The results announced Tuesday lifted TiVo's slumping stock by more than 4 percent in extended trading.
TiVo also announced it is buying Cubiware, a Polish maker of software that helps pay-TV providers design and manage the interactive menus for their services. The deal represents TiVo's latest attempt to expand its presence in markets outside the U.S. Terms of the acquisition weren't disclosed.
TiVo earned $7.9 million, or 8 cents per share, during the three months ending in April. That represented a 3 percent dip from income of $8.1 million, or 7 cents per share, at the same time last year. The decline was driven largely by an additional $1.8 million in interest expenses stemming from debt taken on last September.

The per-share earnings in the most recent quarter were a penny above the average estimate of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue for the quarter totaled $114.7 million  nearly $3 million higher than analysts' predictions.
The San Jose, California, company ended April with 5.76 million subscribers, up from 5.47 million in January. Most of those subscribers were picked up through TiVo's partnerships with pay-TV providers. TiVo added 39,000 households that subscribe to its service directly through the company during the fiscal first quarter.
