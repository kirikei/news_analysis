or
Keira Knightley and James Righton have officially welcomed their first child into the world. 
Multiple sources confirmed E! News  that Knightley has given birth, though there's no word on the sex or name of the baby. 
The "Imitation Game" star was a fashion bombshell during awards season as she walked many red carpets with a sizable baby bump decorated in couture gowns. 
While campaigning for the film she admitted on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" that she and her husband had no real birthing plan except to "get it out" and joked that she was most looking forward to being able to have a margarita again.
