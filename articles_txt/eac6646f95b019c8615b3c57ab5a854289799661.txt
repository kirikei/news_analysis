Apparently Twitter isn't the only technology company interested in Flipboard. A new report alleges that Google and Yahoo reached out to Flipboard for a possible deal.
Following the news of Twitter ’s alleged interest in acquiring Flipboard , the Wall Street Journal is now saying that Google and Yahoo also held discussions with the creators of the popular news reader application—an obvious sign of interest. Yesterday, we reported that an all-stock deal with Twitter will raise Flipboard’s value to around $1 billion.
Sources told the Wall Street Journal that Google and Yahoo are interested in buying Flipboard. However, the talks were reportedly unsuccessful because they couldn’t agree on the price. During the discussions, Google and Yahoo figured out a way to integrate Flipboard’s technology into their products.
The report ratified Twitter’s interest in Flipboard, saying that the discussions with Twitter went further and eventually settled to a price of around $1 billion. However, sources added that the negotiations have been postponed since April. The Wall Street Journal says that Anthony Noto, the CFO of Twitter, has been aggressively asking Twitter to acquire Flipboard.
Noto reportedly urged the executives at Twitter to acquire Flipboard in 2014. Mr. Noto believes that Flipboard’s cool interface will provide a better user experience for Twitter users. While Twitter is a great tool to track breaking news, the social network can be overwhelming, especially if you are following lots of people and news sources.
