In a no-surprise election Tuesday, April 7, incumbent Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman, along with all other incumbent candidates for city council, cleaned house.
Goodman beat challenger Stavros Anthony, mayor pro tem, 55 percent to 42 percent. The two other candidates, Phil Cory and Abdul Shabazz, combined had less than five percent of the vote.
It was a heated battle between Goodman and Anthony, however, with Anthony positioning himself as a better steward of public funds after a failed attempt by Goodman to bring a soccer stadium downtown. The now-abandoned plan would have cost taxpayers $56 million, and bring in a Major League Soccer team to Las Vegas.
The election was a costly one for the two, with Anthony spending more than $280,000 on the campaign, and Goodman spending more than $755,000.
In other city council races, incumbents Ricki Barlow, Bob Coffin and Lois Tarkanian retain seats in Las Vegas, Gerri Schroder, Debra March and Sam Bateman in Henderson and Pamela Goynes-Brown in North Las Vegas. The majority of votes were cast early by mail or early voting sites.
