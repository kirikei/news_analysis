How to mark the anniversary? Have a celebration. Invite folks to camp, splash in the Virgin River and barbecue some property-grown Bundy beef near the web-site of where Bundy says he took a constitutional stand against federal authority on state land.

We're celebrating freedom," family members matriarch Carol Bundy said Friday as campers arrived in motor residences and tents for a three-day event on and about the Bundy melon farm and cattle ranch outdoors Bunkerville.
American flags and other banners fluttered from poles Friday at a website that became a speakers' platform in the course of the days ahead of and right after the standoff final year. Volunteers have been setting up chairs and lighting below a highway bridge more than the wide flat river plain.

He's taken the fight to the statehouse, urging like-minded lawmakers in Nevada, Alaska, Arizona, Utah and quite a few other Western states to pass laws to seize handle of vast tracts of federally controlled lands.
In Nevada, where the federal government controls much more than 80 percent of the land region, Bundy and his son, Ammon Bundy, led a March 31 rally to the state Legislature in Carson City. They referred to as for help for a broad declaration that the federal government has no proper to public lands.
Bills in other states commonly get in touch with for studies of federal land ownership or demand the federal government turn over the lands.
Issues about the constitutionality of some provisions of the Nevada measure prompted a rewrite, but it is due for an Assembly vote later this month. Ammon Bundy issued a statement Friday saying the revised measure was worth supporting.
In Alaska, critics and a legislative attorney attacked a bill to transfer federal lands to the state as unconstitutional, even though the bill sponsor maintained that with so considerably public land controlled by the federal government, the state misses chances to create natural resources, gather income and make jobs.
In Arizona, lawmakers approved bills to ask the federal government to transfer lands to the state before 2022 and to stick to Utah into a state compact to make a commission to secure sovereignty and jurisdiction more than public lands. The measures await Gov. Doug Ducey's signature.
