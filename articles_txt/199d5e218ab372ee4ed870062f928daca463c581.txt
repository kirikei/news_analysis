Dick, Liz Cheney releasing new book slamming Obama
(CNN)
Former Vice President Dick Cheney is releasing a new book co-authored with his daughter Liz Cheney aimed squarely at President Barack Obama.
The hawkish former vice president's new book, "Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America," is slated for release Sept. 1 and is already available for pre-order on Amazon.
The book is being billed as a blistering criticism of Obama's foreign policy, claiming that Obama has abandoned the tradition of American leadership in the world.
Obama has "significantly diminished" American power just as the threat of terrorism is "rapidly growing," Cheney said in a statement his publisher released to the Associated Press.
The announcement comes less than nine months after Cheney and his daughter penned a n editorial in The Wall Street Journal last summer critical of what they called "the collapsing Obama doctrine."
"Despite clear evidence of the dire need for American leadership around the world, the desperation of our allies and the glee of our enemies, President Obama seems determined to leave office ensuring he has taken America down a notch," the pair wrote in the opinion piece.
Cheney was a key player in the decision to invade Iraq in 2003, which was based on the false premise that Saddam Hussein was developing nuclear weapons. Cheney has refused to apologize for his role in spurring the Iraq War and has ramped up his criticism of the Obama foreign policy as ISIS has risen out of the ashes of turmoil in Iraq.
Cheney's daughter, Liz, unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi in the Republican primary in Wyoming. She quickly dropped out.
