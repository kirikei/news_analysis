Rihanna has never been one to hold her tongue when it comes to her thoughts on a matter, and this time she’s making sure the entire state of Indiana hears her out. While performing during the March Madness Music Fest in the state this past weekend, the 27-year-old Bajan beauty debuted her new song “American Oxygen,” which dives into the pride behind America’s controversial history. After performing the inspirational song, RiRi spoke out on the new Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which is a controversial law that the government is in the process of trying to pass.
Reports say that the Act will make it possible for business owners to turn down service to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender customers if they cite faith as the justification for their refusal. The controversial law has certainly ruffled some feathers, leading Rihanna to share her raw thoughts with the crowd. She said to the audience at the concert while on stage, “Who’s feeling these new bulls–t laws that they’re trying to pass over here? I say f–k that s–t. “We’re just living our mother–king lives, Indiana!”
Rihanna encouraged the crowd to chant “f–k that s–t” along with her, in hopes that it would be heard by those in attendance who may have power.
