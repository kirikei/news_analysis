NEW ORLEANS — A federal appeals court on Tuesday denied the Obama administration’s request to lift a hold on the president’s executive actions on immigration, which would have granted protection from deportation as well as work permits to millions of immigrants in the country illegally.
Two of three judges on a panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, left in place an injunction by a federal district judge in Brownsville, Texas. The ruling comes in a lawsuit by 26 states against actions President Barack Obama took in November.
The appeals court found that Texas and the other states had sufficient legal grounds to bring the lawsuit and that the administration had not shown that it would be harmed if the injunction remained in place.
Lassa fever death
WASHINGTON — A team of federal disease experts is in New Jersey working with hospitals that treated a man who died from Lassa fever Monday night, as health officials in that state try to identify and track people who came into contact with him.
The patient, who has not been identified, had come from Liberia earlier in May.
Lassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa but rarely seen in the United States. It can have symptoms similar to Ebola — diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding — but is less infectious and far less likely to be fatal. About 1 percent of Lassa patients die, compared with about 70 percent of Ebola patients.
