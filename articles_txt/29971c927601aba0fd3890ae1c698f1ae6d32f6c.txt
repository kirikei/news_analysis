Around 25 Kenyan police have been killed in al Shabaab attacks in the east of the country.
Some 20 police died in an ambush on Monday evening in Yumbis village, 70km north of the town of Garissa, where the terrorist group massacred more than 140 students at a university in April.
Others died when their vehicle hit a landmine planted by the militants.
According to the group's military spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, they also burnt five vehicles.
He said: 'We took all their weapons.'
'There were some Kenyan forces that escaped in the course of the ambush fighting.'
Kenyan police confirmed there had been an attack.
Last week, al Shabaab attacked Yumbis and hoisted their flag on a mosque where they held prayers before heading to another nearby village.
Al Shabaab has carried out several attacks in Kenya recently in an effort to force Nairobi to withdraw its troops from Somalia.
