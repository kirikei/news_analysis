Jason Statham has always been apprehensive about doing comedy.
The 47-year-old actor made a name for himself in movies such as The Italian Job and The Transporter.
But Jason's latest vehicle sees him show his humorous side, by starring alongside Melissa McCarthy in Spy.
However, Jason admits he was more than a little worried about turning his hand to a different genre.
"I've always been apprehensive about trying to do a f**king comedy, because they're either brilliant or they're f**king terrible," Jason told Esquire magazine. "At least in making an action film, there's always going to be someone who wants to see a car chase. Even if a lot of the people don't like it, there will be a lot of people that do. But bad comedy is just garbage. But this works, and I give a lot of the credit--or all of the f**king credit--to [director] Paul Feig and the writing."
Spy tells the story of a CIA analyst, played by Melissa, who volunteers to go undercover in an attempt to prevent a global disaster.
And while Jason perhaps wasn't a natural choice for the comedic role, director Paul told the publication that he was his first port of call.
"Jason makes every movie better," he said. "I hate comedy that's trying to be funny. Jason doesn't have to try. He gets it. In every movie, people pick up on his good-natured ways. And I've known that he was funny ever since that first Crank movie. Crank is ridiculous. He's so good in it."
