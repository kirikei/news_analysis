Periscope , the new live streaming app owned by Twitter has now made its way to Android. Previously launched for iOS, the new app will provide users with a new way to start or watch a live video broadcast. Twitter made this announcement on its Blog Post  and stated that Android users using 4.4.4 KitKat or above can download the app from Google Play Store .
According to the company statement , Periscope on Android has all the same core features that Periscope users have come to love: start a public or private broadcast, choose to allow comments from just those you follow, and interact with a broadcaster by chatting or sending hearts.
In addition, Periscope for Android has a few unique features which aren’t spotted on iOS. The new app includes a Material-inspired design that should feel familiar but modern to Android users. App users will also have a granular control over additional Push Notification settings, such as ‘First Time Broadcast notifications’ and and ‘Share notifications’.
It also offers a ‘Resume notification’ for users who can continue to watch their videos where they left off from, in case their broadcast gets interrupted by a call or message. In other features, Replays are saved without requiring the broadcaster to upload a file as well. This can save the broadcasters time and mobile data too.
Live streaming on Twitter became a craze with the introduction of Meerat, a similar live streaming app which was being called the new  Twitter sensation . However, Twitter took advantage of the situation and blocked the rival app and purchased Periscope, so as to monetize from this opportunity. Apparently,  Meerkat CEO Ben Rubin stated that this move by the micro-blogging site could help it grow.
