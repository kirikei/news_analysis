Details of how the bipartisan bill rewriting Medicare reimbursement of doctors, awaiting congressional approval this month, would squeeze savings from the health care program for the elderly:
AMOUNT OF MEDICARE PREMIUMS
-Current law: Most people pay $105 monthly for medical coverage, which is 25 percent of the program’s cost. The prescription drug premium varies widely, according to plan and region.
People earning at least $85,000 annually pay higher premiums, which grow as income increases. Top-earning individuals making more than $214,000 pay 80 percent of the program’s costs, or $336 monthly for medical coverage. The income thresholds double for couples.

MEDIGAP
-Current law: People can purchase policies that insure virtually all costs not covered by Medicare.
-Medicare legislation: Starting with people buying new policies in 2020, coverage would be limited to costs above Medicare’s deductible for medical costs, which is currently $147 monthly but could be higher by then.
