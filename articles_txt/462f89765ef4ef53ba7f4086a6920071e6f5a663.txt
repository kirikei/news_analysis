Rand Paul's first tech test
With Tuesdayâs campaign launch, the Kentucky senator gets a big chance to prove his digital savvy.
Rand Paul bills himself as a different kind of Republican, a digital-savvy conservative who can expand the GOP electorate beyond its traditional boundaries.
So when he formally announces his presidential campaign Tuesday, one of the first tests will be behind the scenes as he attempts to amplify his message beyond the Louisville, Ky., launch event and reach many voters where they now live — online.

The framework is already in place, according to his team. Different domains will funnel traffic to the same official campaign website. Google staffers plan to be with Paul’s top aides in Louisville., as well as a satellite campaign office in Austin, Texas, to help decipher the optimal moments to blast out digital ads and measure their real-time web performance. And Paul isn’t just using social media like Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter to spread word about his political ambitions. He’s also pushing out all-important links to his own website, where he can solicit donations, email addresses and other vital information that will lead to more asks for money, more invitations to attend rallies and more ways for people to engage with his expected upstart presidential bid.
It may all seem like 21st-century White House campaigning 101. But these are essentials that budget-strapped outfits can miss — just ask Ted Cruz, who as the first presidential candidate out of the gate failed to secure key website domains with his name and also sent out links directing potential boosters away from his official campaign page — not deadly campaign errors, but rather missed opportunities. For Paul, there won’t be a bigger test this year for his much-hyped tech team as it takes its turn among a field of crowded Republican contenders in feeding off the free media spotlight and that small segment of the American public that willingly tunes in for these kinds of events.
Paul’s moment won’t last long. Marco Rubio has a “big announcement” planned for April 13 in Miami, and Hillary Clinton is expected to follow soon after. Both likely campaign roll-outs will be closely scrutinized to see if they are using the latest and greatest tech tools right from the start to rally boosters for fundraising, volunteering and, ultimately, voting.
“There will be thousands of events between now and Iowa that just don’t produce a lot of rain,” said Scott Tranter, co-founder of Washington-based 0ptimus, a data and technology firm working for Rubio. “[Launch days] are automatic rainmakers and you’ve got to catch what you can.”
When it comes to his campaign’s tech game, Paul tends to be one step ahead of his 2016 competitors. He’s been courting Silicon Valley’s libertarian-minded leaders since his first Senate campaign in 2010. Last November, Paul hired Cruz’s top digital strategist. On the web, Paul regularly trolls his 2016 rivals with snarky tweets and gimmicky hashtags (#StandwithRand #thingstorunfrom #hillaryslosers). His digital team created a fake phone conversations between Clinton and Jeb Bush widely shared on social media, and Paul has even paid for ads running atop the leading search engine results for his opponents.
“Sen. Paul is clearly running a very different type of organization,” said Vincent Harris, the former Cruz tech adviser now working as chief digital strategist for RANDPAC, Paul’s political arm. “I’d expect Tuesday to be another continuous reflection of a tech-foward operation, of a crowd-sourced campaign that will use digital that’s never been used before on the Republican side.”
Democratic and Republican digital strategists question whether Paul’s online trolling will backfire as he tries reaching beyond his traditional base of libertarians and conservative-minded techies. But Paul is counting on being rewarded for bringing to the GOP presidential field some of the same creative digital elements and outreach that Obama used to great effect in 2008 in challenging the Democratic establishment and thwarting Clinton’s first White House bid. At the very least, Paul’s online presence should pay off dividends in his bank account.
“They will raise a ton of money online,” said Blaise Hazelwood, a longtime GOP digital operative working closely with another potential 2016er, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. “It’ll be impressive, I have no doubt.”

Rubio, the next candidate readying for launch, has the makings of a solid tech effort too. On social media, the Florida senator routinely chats up his Twitter followers and ahead of his announcement he’s been pushing links that direct traffic back to his official website, marcorubio.com , where a form asks for pertinent contact information for future fundraising and organizing outreach.
Republicans say Rubio is still mulling what kind of organizational chart he’ll use for his in-house campaign tech team. But some of the elements are already there on the outside in Michael Harinstein as digital director of the Rubio-affiliated PAC Reclaim America; South Carolina-based shop Push Digital , which is handling a share of the online effort; and 0ptimus , Tranter’s 11-man operation that includes a Yale-trained clinical psychologist and a University of Maryland Ph.D. political science professor.
“Our job through math and science is to make sure every dollar our client spends is worth $1.20,” Tranter explained.
On the Clinton front, Democrats say they are eager for the presumptive front-runner to launch her campaign for fundraising purposes and to get an official candidate swinging back at the constant stream of Republican attacks. But her formal campaign announcement — spearheaded on the tech side by several Obama 2012 veterans , including chief digital strategist Teddy Goff — is more about reintroducing a woman who has been on the national political stage for more than two decades, rather than building up a core file of her supporters.
Paul isn’t just using social media like Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter to spread word about his political ambitions.
“It’s a lot different if it’s your day one and you are Rand Paul and half the country doesn’t know who you are, versus someone who is really well known,” said a senior Democratic technology strategist planning to work on Clinton’s behalf.
Clinton is expected from the start to have access to two potent collections of names, email addresses and other useful information — Obama’s vaunted 2012 campaign list of roughly 12 million supporters, and a separate list of about four million people gathered over the last two years by the outside group Ready for Hillary. While the legal details for the lists’ transfer are still being worked out, Democratic strategists say they expect both will eventually help Clinton raise money and build her team of volunteer field staffers.
“She’s not going to need to do much” on launch day, said another Democratic digital aide with ties to Clinton. “A lot of that data is there. She doesn’t need to maximize as much as some of the other folks do.”
Cruz’s move to be the first 2016 candidate out of the gate appears to be all about maximizing his time in the spotlight. The Texas Republican’s campaign boasted to POLITICO that he’s added more than 34,000 donors to his files since his announcement and raised about $1.5 million online in just the two days after the launch speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., with almost all of that money coming through checks smaller than $250.
The Houston-based Cruz campaign — led on the digital, research and analytics front by pollster Chris Wilson — is working off a national voter file that has identified the GOP primary electorate’s preferences for the entire 2016 field. A team of 10 data and behavioral scientists has been studying which groups of potential supporters should get which online ads and messages — different images tied to gun rights and the Second Amendment, for example, go to different groups. And Cruz is also taking a page out of the digital playbook of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee by carpet-bombing in-boxes with repeated pleas for small-dollar donations and slightly-tweaked subject lines (“Hillary’s Watching” or “What’s Hillary looking at”) which can be tested to see which messages prompt the best responses from his core conservative base.
“We have the ability to quickly and accurately model the voter electorate and fundraising base as quickly and as extensively as we need to,” said a senior Cruz adviser.
But Democrats and Republicans said Cruz could have probably done even better raising money and collecting email addresses of potential supporters if he’d nailed down some campaign tech fundamentals. His tweet breaking news that he would run for president went out shortly after midnight East coast time on a Monday — not an ideal moment to generate fundraising dollars and web traffic. He also failed to get the rights by his launch date to multiple domains with his name, including tedcruz.com , now a page with pro-Obama immigration message that was purchased back in 2004 about a year after Cruz became Texas solicitor general. Digital strategists also question why Cruz used email messages and his social media accounts to repeatedly link to a YouTube page with campaign videos instead of directing visitors to a landing site on his official website where he could capture vital information about his potential supporters — and then connect to the videos.
“That’s a nice thing for Google, but not for the campaign,” said Matthew Compton , digital director at the Democratic National Committee.
Cruz did get one lucky break: the owner of two key “tedcruz2016” sites agreed after his announcement to redirect traffic to the Republican’s official site, tedcruz.org .
