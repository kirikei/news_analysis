LAS VEGAS  --  Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman maintained a lead throughout the night and easily won the mayor's seat for a second term with 54 percent of the total vote.
Precinct results starting coming in shortly after 8 p.m. and by 9 p.m. Goodman already had 54 percent of the vote. Her main opponent, Las Vegas City Councilman Stavros Anthony was at 44 percent. All the precincts had reported by 9:45 p.m.
Results also showed the majority of voters, 28,000, took part in early voting with only 18,000 going to the polls on Tuesday, according to the Clark County Election Department.
A failed soccer stadium bid is at the heart of a challenge to unseat Goodman.
Voters in Las Vegas went to polls Tuesday to decide if the wife of former-mayor and attorney Oscar Goodman should be re-elected to another four-year term or if her challenger should take the top spot.
Anthony is a former Las Vegas police captain serving a second council term.
Goodman backed a partly publicly-funded downtown soccer stadium. Anthony has argued it shouldn't involve public funds. The deal ultimately failed.
Four people are running for mayor. The top two vote-getters will face a runoff in June unless one gets 50 percent of the vote plus one.
The City of Las Vegas doesn't include the Las Vegas Strip.
