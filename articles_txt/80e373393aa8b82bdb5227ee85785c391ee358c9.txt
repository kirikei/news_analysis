PASCO — Friday will mark the two-month anniversary since a Mexican man was shot and killed by police in Pasco.
Several Latino groups are planning marches this Friday and Saturday to mark the death of 35-year-old Antonio Zambrano-Montes.
The Washington Dream Act Coalition says Friday’s vigil will be at the busy intersection in Pasco where the man was shot. Saturday there will be a rally and march at Volunteer Park in Pasco.
Three Pasco police officers are on paid administrative leave as the local investigation into the shooting continues. Some local residents are continuing to call for a federal investigation into the shooting of the unarmed man on Feb. 10.
