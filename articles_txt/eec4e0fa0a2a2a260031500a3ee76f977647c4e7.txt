The flyer disputes earlier claims by Kruger that North American Islamic Trust, 721 Enterprise Drive, has no ties with Islamic extremist groups. In addition, the flyer disputes the group's tax exempt status and zoning of the home on which its offices are positioned.
&quotThey stated they are a church," said Fred Cappetta, Natalie's father, an lawyer who vetted the flyer before it was sent out. &quotIf they are a church, the zoning doesn't allow for them to be exactly where they are at."
Oak Brook Village Manager Rick Ginex mentioned the IRS and DuPage County granted any tax-exempt status for North American Islamic Trust.
