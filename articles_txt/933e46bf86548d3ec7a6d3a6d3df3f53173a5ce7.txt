HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut Republicans are considering replacing their 2016 presidential primary with a caucus to draw more candidates to the state to campaign rather than just raise money.
Hearst Connecticut Media reports ( http://bit.ly/1CwkJLd ) that Michael Garrett , a Republican State Central Committee member, said if state law must be changed, Republicans acknowledge that the Democratic-run legislature would not likely approve legislation.
The Connecticut GOP is seeking legal opinions on whether the legislature could be bypassed.
A GOP caucus would be set for each of the state's 36 state Senate districts.
Caucuses often resemble town meetings, with party members debating the merits of the candidates before casting their votes. A primary is more similar to a general election.
