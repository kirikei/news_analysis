Maine ex-lawmaker throws jar of Vaseline at Paul LePage

Maine Gov. Paul LePage’s town hall meeting on the state’s budget came to an abrupt end on Thursday night after a former state representative interrupted him and tossed a jar of Vaseline in his general direction.
Former Democratic state Rep. Joanne Twomey shouted at LePage during a question-and-answer session, according to CBS affiliate WGME, and then threw the Vaseline container on the stage as security personnel escorted her out of the room.

“Oh yes, I threw the jar at the stage,” Twomey told the TV station.
Twomey, who served in the Maine House of Representatives from 1998 to 2006, said later that the meeting in Saco “was not very democratic.”
“If people thought the Vaseline was out of line, I’m sorry, but he is out of line with what he is going to do to the people of Maine,” she said, according to the Portland Press Herald . According to that report, Twomey was handcuffed and removed from a 1992 Biddeford City Council meeting, but the charges of criminal trespassing were later dropped.
She said she picked Vaseline to throw at the Republican governor because of comments he made in 2013 about Democratic state Sen. Troy Jackson.
“Sen. Jackson claims to be for the people but he’s the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline,” LePage said at the time, adding that Jackson “is a bad person” with “no brains” and a “black heart.”
