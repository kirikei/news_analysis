This week, veteran CBS News anchor Bob Schieffer announced he would retire from hosting “Face the Nation.” Sunday on the show, it was revealed that John Dickerson, the political director for the network, will take his place this summer.
“Now the obvious question is, who’s going to take this seat? I’m happy to say the answer is my friend CBS News political director John Dickerson, who has been on this broadcast 83 times. And he sure has the right bloodlines,” Mr. Schieffer said on his show Sunday.
The “bloodline” he was referring to is Mr. Dickerson’s mother, Nancy Dickerson, who in 1960 became the first female correspondent for CBS News.
Mr. Dickerson, 46, followed in her journalism footsteps, but began his career in print media. He was a reporter for Time magazine from 1993 until 2005, then a writer for Slate. In April 2009, Mr. Dickerson joined CBS as an on-air political analyst. Two years later, he was named political director.
In the announcement from the network, CBS News President David Rhodes stressed Mr. Dickerson’s reporting chops.
“John is first and foremost a reporter - and that’s what he’ll be as anchor of ’Face the Nation,’” Mr. Rhodes said. “His work in the studio will always be informed by what he’s learned in Iowa, in New Hampshire, on Capitol Hill - anywhere there’s news. He has earned the respect of newsmakers across the political spectrum.”
Mr. Dickerson was recently criticized for a Slate story headlined “Go for the Throat!” that concluded that President Obama should move to “declare war” on his Republican opponents in his second term if they continue to oppose him at every turn.
Slate editor Julia Turner said Mr. Dickerson will continue to write for the site and participate in its podcast Political Gabfest. His title will change from chief political correspondent to contributing columnist.
“He is serious and rigorous but so charming, funny and genuine that no matter what he’s doing, whether that’s asking questions, writing a critical piece or pressing hard on an issue, he does it in a way that seems fair, wise, and engenders respect for his readers and subjects,” Ms. Turner said.
As White House correspondent for Time during the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Dickerson was known for getting called on, apparently because the president and his staff found Mr. Dickerson charming. He did not throw softball questions in return.
“Every now and then, the press has its day,” wrote Mike Allen in The Washington Post in 2004. “The master of the game is John Dickerson of Time magazine, who has knocked Bush off script so many times that his colleagues have coined a term for cleverly worded, seemingly harmless, but incisive questions: ‘Dickersonian.’ “
In his new role on “Face the Nation,” Mr. Dickerson will be taking the place of a man who has been hosting the Sunday news program for 24 of his 46 years with CBS. Mr. Schieffer announced his retirement on Wednesday during a speech at his alma mater, Texas Christian University.
