The harsh public education of Colin Kaepernick continues unabated.
The 49ers quarterback, who had drawn widespread praise for working with Kurt Warner and others on his throwing mechanics this offseason, found his way into the social media doghouse Tuesday when he sent a photo to his Instagram and Twitter followers of cars in Houston being overcome by flooding with the words "I told you the #7tormsComing !!! #Houston"
To be fair, Kaepernick (jersey No. 7) has been using the #7tormsComing hashtag for some time now, apparently his latest me-against-the-world social media mantra. (He's also been using #IDontGetTired and #WhoDoYouLove)
So when he heard there was a storm in Houston, it probably seemed like perfect chip-on-the-shoulder fodder. Even if he should've checked on the human capital first; the cars below water in the picture he chose might've provided a decent clue.
"Uhh, people are dying" came one of the more polite Twitter replies.
Kap seemed to get the vibe quickly and tweeted "No disrespect intended! Prayers up!"
But when people wouldn't let it go that easily, he tweeted out a full-scale apology that hit the right notes, including: "I didn't fully understand how many people are struggling in Houston right now and I feel horrible."
That should allow most normal people to forgive and forget. But it also might be just enough to reinvorgate the Kaepernick cynics.
