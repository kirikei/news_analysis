Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid still can't see out of his right eye after an accident in the gym earlier this year .
"I'm sightless in my right eye," he told Univision host Jorge Ramos, in an interview Tuesday.
But he also said he's not scared. "I can't see out of my eye, and that's the way it's going to be until something comes along that'll change it."
"I can live with that," he added.

Reid said he has already had 11 hours of surgery for the accident, which occurred when an exercise band he was using at his home in Nevada snapped. He fell, resulting in four broken ribs and several broken bones near his right eye.
The minority leader announced late last month that he would not run for re-election in 2016 , choosing to focus on bringing Democrats back to power in the Senate rather than his own re-election. In a radio interview with KNPR before he announced his retirement, however, he said the injury would not factor into that decision.
