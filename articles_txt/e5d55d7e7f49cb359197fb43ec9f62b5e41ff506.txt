MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The makeup of the Wisconsin Supreme Court and how its chief justice is chosen are at stake in an election that has drawn little attention in the state.
Two questions affecting the state's highest court are on Tuesday's ballot. The first involves the race between incumbent Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, who is seeking a third 10-year term, and her challenger, Rock County Circuit Judge James Daley.
Bradley is one of the seven-member court's two liberal justices. Daley has actively courted Republicans as he tries to increase the conservative majority.
Voters also are considering a constitutional amendment that would change the 126-year-old practice of having the most senior justice serve as chief justice. Opponents say it's a blatant attack on liberal Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson, who's held the position since 1996.
