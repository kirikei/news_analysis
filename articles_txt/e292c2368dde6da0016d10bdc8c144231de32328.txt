After earlier reports that a trade involving Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Juan Uribe and Atlanta Braves infielder Alberto Callaspo was dead, FoxSports reported Tuesday night that the deal was back on.
According to the report, six players are involved in the trade, with Uribe and Callaspo being the principals. The deal is pending approval from the commissioner’s office.
Callaspo initially rejected the deal that would send him to the Dodgers, but he later reportedly waived the right to reject the trade before June 15.
The Braves announced that he was scratched from Tuesday’s lineup “due to trade talks being revisited.”
Callaspo, 32, is hitting .206 with eight RBIs in 107 at-bats this season. He hit .223 for the Oakland A’s last season.
Uribe is batting .247 with one home run this season after hitting .311 with nine home runs in 2014. He is making $6.5 million this season in the final year of a two-year, $15 million deal.
Uribe’s departure would allow Dodgers rookie Alex Guerrero to get more playing time at third.
