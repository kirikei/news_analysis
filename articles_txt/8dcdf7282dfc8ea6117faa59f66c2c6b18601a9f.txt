INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - An Indiana Senate panel is set to vote on a Republican-led push to repeal the state law that sets wages for public construction projects.
Senate Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee members are scheduled to vote Tuesday morning on a proposal that would eliminate the Common Construction Wage Law, which requires boards to set wages for each state or local project that costs more than $350,000.
Supporters argue that the wages are set artificially high and hinder the competitive market from lowering bid prices and saving taxpayer money. Critics say eliminating the law will decrease labor productivity, construction quality and worker salaries.
The committee will also vote on proposed changes that would establish harsh punishments for contractors who abuse work rules and require an employee training program.
