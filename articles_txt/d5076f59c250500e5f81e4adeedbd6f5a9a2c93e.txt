FRANKFORT, Ky.
If Wisconsin manages to stop Kentucky's win streak Saturday in their NCAA men's Final Four basketball game, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will win a basket of his own, filled with Kentucky bourbons from Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear.
Beshear and Walker are wagering on their home teams, and Walker bet a basket of Wisconsin cheese, sausage and root beer.
Beshear's office says the bourbons are from Lexington-area distillers and are provided by the Kentucky Distillers' Association.
Kentucky (38-0) will tip off against Wisconsin (35-3) at 8:49 p.m. EDT Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The winner advances to the championship game Monday against the winner of Saturday's game between Michigan State and Duke.
