President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, and daughters Malia and Sasha were in Virginia on Easter Sunday.
President Obama and his family spent Easter Sunday at a historic black church in Virginia as the minister gave a sermon that mixed politics and scripture.
Obama was joined by wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia at the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria. For the holiday, they also posed for an official White House photo.
The church’s pastor, the Rev. Howard-John Wesley, 42, who like Michelle Obama is a native of Chicago’s South Side, gave a rousing sermon about the responsibility of choice.
“Where do you stand with rights for same-sex couples . . . where do you stand on gun reform, where do you stand with police body cameras?” Wesley asked the congregation. “Even today in our political landscape, a line in the sand is drawn forcing you to make a decision on where you stand.”
The church, which dates to 1803, is known for its liberal positions, such as its support for civil rights for same-sex couples, according to the Washington Post.
“It was an honor to just worship with the President,” Wesley told the Post.
But at one point, as excited worshipers gave Obama the rock star treatment, Wesley warned them: “This is not selfie time. Let the brother worship in the house of God.”
