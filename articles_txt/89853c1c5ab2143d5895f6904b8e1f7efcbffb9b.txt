AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Senate has approved a bill making it easier for terminally ill patients to get experimental drugs that have yet to receive federal approval.
The "Right to Try Act" by Houston Republican Sen. Paul Bettencourt passed 31-0 Thursday and now heads to the House.
The Food and Drug Administration already allows patients with physicians' permission to get experimental drugs via a "compassionate use" exception. His bill attempts to create an expedited state process.
Bettencourt said it would "get government out of the way" and let patients "fight with any resources they can."
But he also tweaked his proposal to answer concerns it could allow swindlers with false drugs to prey on desperate patients.
Colorado, Arizona, Louisiana, Michigan and Missouri have already approved similar measures.
