Aussies agree to reconsider ‘sexist tampon tax’
SYDNEY: Australia’s Treasurer Joe Hockey will reconsider what has been dubbed the “tampon tax” after a campaign by a university student rallied nearly 100,000 supporters in branding the levy sexist.
When Australia introduced a Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2000, health products such as condoms and sunscreen were exempt from the 10% charge.
But tampons and other women’s hygiene products were not, despite an outcry at the time.
Hockey admitted late Monday that tampons “probably should” be considered essential health products and therefore GST-free, but said any decision would have to be backed by state and territory governments.
“I will raise it with the states at the next meeting of the treasurers in July,” Hockey told student Subeta Vimalarajah whose “Stop Taxing My Period!’ petition has attracted 93,500 signatures.
In her online petition, Vimalarajah pointed out that “people who get periods don’t buy pads and tampons for pleasure, so why are we forced to fork out an extra 10% every two, three, four weeks?” — AFP
