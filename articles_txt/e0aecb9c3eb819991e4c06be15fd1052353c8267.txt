CLEVELAND — LeBron James only needed three quarters to complete his task Tuesday night, but he was in no mood to sit as the final 12 minutes of the Cleveland Cavaliers’ series-clinching, 118-88 victory over the Atlanta Hawks played out. James had to stand andadmire what he had returned home to build, hopping up and down to celebrate every ridiculous fallaway jumper by J.R. Smith, a put-back dunk by Timofey Mosgov, a friendly-bounce jump hook by Kendrick Perkins or a nifty ball fake by Joe Harris.
The raucous fans, draped in bright yellow T-shirts, erupted with each basket and they had earned the right to gloat and get lost in the euphoria or dominating sweep of the top seed in the Eastern Conference. Cleveland waited eight years to experience the feeling again and suffered through four years of watching James find success in Miami. They’ve come together and the reunion couldn’t have been sweeter. By the time there was five minutes left, Quicken Loans Arena was filled with chants of “N-B-A Finals!”
James and Cavaliers are four wins short of the first championship since the franchise was created in 1970 and the first title of any kind in the city since Jim Brown and the Browns won the NFL championship in 1964. The team that is heading to the NBA Finals doesn’t resemble the group that James signed back with in July, or the group that showed up for training camp.
They Cavaliers entered with high expectations because of the all-star pairing of James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving but sputtered for two months until Cavaliers General Manager David Griffin made two season-altering deals, raiding lottery teams in New York and Denver, respectively, for two sharpshooting wing players and a defensive anchor at center. But the transformation continued through the postseason as James needed put together arguably his most impressive performance, coming three assists shy of averaging a triple double over the four games and carrying a hobbled roster and a rookie NBA coach with plenty of international success in David Blatt.
“I knew I was going to have to be patient,” James said. “We have everything it takes to win. We have grit, we have determination and we have a willingness to want to be great.”

James had 23 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in just 29 minutes and became the first player in NBA history to reach five consecutive Finals on two teams and he did it by dispatching his second 60-win in the process. Realizing what he signed up for when he made his return, James felt he was going to need some reinforcements to deliver on the promise he made to Cavaliers when he was a young kid still attempting to understand the full extent of his powers.
But this postseason has served as a reminder of James’s ability to flex his individual gifts but also uplift the players around him. By the end of this series, Love was done for the season after having surgery to repair a separated shoulder and Irving was at less than full strength with tendinitis in his left knee.
Irving missed two games in the series but returned Tuesday seeking to gain some confidence in his knee before the Finals. Though he didn’t have his usual explosiveness, Irving was effective as he scored 16 points in 21 minutes. Smith, a Knicks reject, had 18 points and 10 rebounds. Mozgov had 14 points and 11 rebounds and Matthew Dellavedova solidified himself as a cult hero in this town by becoming a hard-nose irritant and adding 10 points.
The Hawks’ best season in 45 years ended with a whimper as they meekly gave in to an overwhelming tide of injuries and unfortunate breaks. All-star point guard Jeff Teague led the Hawks with 17 points and Paul Millsap, who has been playing with a sprained left shoulder for the past six weeks, had a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds.
But Atlanta was never able to overcome losing all-star guard Kyle Korver to a severely sprained ankle and having starting small forward DeMarre Carroll — their most consistent player through the first two rounds — fighting through a left knee injury as he attempted to defend James.
