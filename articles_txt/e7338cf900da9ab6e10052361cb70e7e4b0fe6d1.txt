The Senate voted 45-2 to pass House Bill 1241, which bill carrier Sen. Kelly Armstrong said clarifies, simplifies and expands gun rights in the state.
“Concealed weapons permit holders are not the problem. They’re the good guys. They’re the ones who are the law-abiding citizens,” said Armstrong, R-Dickinson.
The bill removes political rallies or functions, musical concerts, publicly owned parks and publicly owned or operated rest areas or restrooms from the list of places and events where it’s currently a Class B misdemeanor to possess a firearm or dangerous weapon.
It would still be illegal to carry a firearm in a school, publicly owned or operated building or a church without the church’s permission.
Senators also voted 39-2 to pass a bill that would allow college and university employees and students to keep firearms in their vehicles on campus.
The bills now return to the House, which can either concur with the Senate amendments or request a conference committee with members from each chamber to iron out the differences.
