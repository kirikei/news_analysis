LANSING, Mich. – On Thursday, Gov. Rick Snyder signed legislation making it easier for those who aren’t certain of the tax status of their residence to receive qualifying credits.
"Making state government easier to navigate for Michigan residents continues to be a major focus,” Snyder said. “By allowing tax preparers to check whether their low-income and elderly clients are eligible for homestead property tax credits, we are making it easier for residents to file their tax returns correctly and reduces the amount of incorrect property tax credits paid.”
House Bill 4051, sponsored by state Rep. Jeff Farrington, allows the Department of Treasury to disclose to certified tax preparers and free tax assistance programs certain tax data used to process homestead property tax credits. It is now Public Act 10 of 2015.
Snyder also signed Senate Bill 42 on Thursday, which brings Michigan into compliance with federal requirements by making commercial learner’s permits requirements similar to those of commercial drivers’ licenses. The measure, sponsored by state Sen. Tom Casperson, also complies with a court judgment regarding personalized license plates and allows a probationary driver to request a hearing for a license restriction, suspension or revocation instead of the previous requirement that a hearing be held automatically. The bill also clarifies language regarding roadside sobriety tests to ensure results are admissible in court. It is now Public Act 11 of 2015.
