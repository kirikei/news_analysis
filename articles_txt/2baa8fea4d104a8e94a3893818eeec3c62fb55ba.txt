SPOKANE, Wash. -
About a dozen people hit the streets in Spokane Saturday afternoon to rally against businesses and employers that discriminate based on race, religion or gender identity. Those that attended Spokane Anti Religious Freedom Restoration Act Rally said that law is unhealthy for society and all people should have equality under the law.
Critics claim the law gives businesses the ability to discriminate by refusing to sell their products and services to the LGBT community. Indiana's Governor Mike Pence said that was not the intent and signed an amendment last week.
Saturday's group in Spokane said they hoped that something like Indiana's Freedom Restoration Act will not make its way to Spokane.
"This is the civil rights issue of our time, and I think people in Spokane have a lot to say about it. To give us an opportunity to come together and rally together, it's a fun exciting and beautiful thing," said rally organizer Bryce Peterson.
"I'm glad to see there's a voice in Spokane that's anti what other people are calling religious freedom. It's not religious freedom what they're preaching there. It's just hate. We don't want to have any hate in Spokane," said Pastor Jan Shannon.
