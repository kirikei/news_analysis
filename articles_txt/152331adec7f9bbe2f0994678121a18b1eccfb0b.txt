In a new interview out today, former president Bill Clinton talks about his limited role in his wife’s expected presidential campaign and defends the Clinton Foundation’s controversial donations from foreign nations.
Clinton talked to Town & Country about the philanthropic work of the foundation, specifically regarding Haiti. However, he does indulge the political gossip for a bit, talking as if the Hillary Clinton campaign is a sure thing. (As of now, it almost definitely is, but not officially confirmed.)
Clinton says, “My role should primarily be as a backstage adviser to her until we get much, much closer to the election.” He admits that he’s likely not going to do much campaigning because he doesn’t have the fire for it that he once did.
But as for those controversial foundation donations (that Rand Paul has already made into an issue of sorts ), this is what the former president has to say:
“[It's] the most transparent of all the presidential foundations and more transparent than a lot of other major foundations in the country. It should be, both because I believe in it and because Hillary is in public life, and we’ll get criticized, as some people are criticizing me, for taking money from a foreign government. We did a review of the whole foundation last year.”
