Afghan forces were able to secure the area around the hotel early on Wednesday morning
Four gunmen have been killed after trying to storm a guesthouse in a diplomatic area of the Afghan capital, Kabul, police say.
The attack resulted in an overnight gun battle in the Wazir Akbar Khan district, home to several embassies and official buildings.
The Taliban says it launched the attack. It lasted at least six hours.
The assailants were armed with a rocket propelled grenade launcher and other weapons, the interior ministry said.
No civilian or military casualties were reported.
"Four attackers who had one RPG launcher, three AK-47s and one grenade launcher were killed in Wazir Akbar Khan," deputy interior minister Mohammad Ayoub Salangi said on Twitter.
The four gunmen were killed before reaching their target, Kabul police Abdul Rahman Rahimi said.
As the battle progressed, police said they had surrounded the attackers
Afghanistan's interior ministry told the BBC that the target was the former Heetal guesthouse, that was attacked by the Taliban in December 2009 and is now officially known as the Rabbani Guesthouse.
It is popular with foreigners and is owned by the Rabbani family, including Afghanistan's current Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani, and its former president, Burhanuddin Rabbani.
Earlier, Kabul police spokesman Ebadullah Karimi said the attackers had taken position among the trees behind the guesthouse.
The hotel manager told AFP news agency that all guests were in safe rooms and no-one was hurt.
"Heetal is very well fortified. After one or two initial explosions, our guards started firing on attackers who were unable to get inside," he said.
Correspondents say that the attackers appear to have tried to enter the hotel by firing a rocket propelled grenade at its heavy steel front gate.
Security forces stood guard outside the guesthouse after the attack
Part of the gate was destroyed, but it was not damaged enough for the militants to get through.
The siege dragged on because police waited until daylight to identify and move in on their targets, officials said.
Security forces blocked roads and took up positions on rooftops, parking armoured personnel vehicles in the streets near the guesthouse.
The stand-off ended with a dawn round of sustained gunfire and big explosions that sent clouds of black smoke into the sky.
The attack began shortly before 23:00 (18:30 GMT). Police were later seen smashing street lights to cover their movements in the dark, the Associated Press reported.
Police were said to have smashed street lights to cover their movements
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder, in Kabul, said he had heard " sustained explosions, small arms fire and also the sound of grenades ".
Reports by witnesses on social media said the fighting was close to the Tajik embassy and Street 15 in the Wazir Akbar Khan district.
While the area is popular with foreign workers and also houses government employees, it has been subject to several high-profile attacks in recent years, most notably in the Taverna du Liban restaurant last year .
In recent weeks, a new wave of attacks by the Taliban has targeted foreigners in Kabul.
Two weeks ago, 14 people were killed as they waited to attend a concert in a guesthouse in Kabul.
With the Taliban's traditional summer offensive under way, the UN says the number of civilians killed and injured across Afghanistan stands at nearly 3,000 over the first four months of the year, up 16% on the same period last year.

No civilians or members of Afghan security forces were killed, authorities say
The Taliban say they targeted a hotel where "foreign invaders" were staying
Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)
Four Taliban militants who launched an hourslong gun and grenade attack in an upscale district of central Kabul have been killed, Afghan authorities said Wednesday.
The sounds of explosions and gunfire echoed through the Afghan capital as fighting between the Taliban attackers and Afghan security forces raged, starting around 11 p.m. Tuesday and continuing into the early hours of Wednesday.
No civilians or members of the security forces were killed in the battle, Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayub Salangi told CNN.
The Taliban said the target of the attack was a hotel owned by the son of Afghanistan's former President. The militants singled out the Heetal Plaza Hotel because "foreign invaders" were staying there, the Taliban said in a statement.
It's the latest in a long series of Taliban attacks targeting foreigners in Afghanistan.
Rocket launcher and other weapons seized
The hotel's manager said its defenses hadn't been breached. The Heetal Plaza is owned by the son of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
Afghan officials said security measures at the hotel and the security forces' response prevented the insurgents from harming anyone before they were killed.
Security forces seized a rocket launcher, three AK-47s and a grenade launcher from the attackers, Salangi said.
The Taliban have targeted hotels in Kabul previously.
Less than two weeks ago, a gun attack on the Park Palace Guest House killed 14 people, many of them foreigners. In March 2014, Taliban militants carried out a deadly assault on the luxury Serena Hotel.
