HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Campaign finance reports are trickling in from candidates in the crowded race for three open seats on Pennsylvania's Supreme Court .
The 12 judges and lawyers competing for the Democratic and Republican nominations must file their reports Tuesday in what could become one of the most expensive judicial campaigns in state history.
Among the early filers are Commonwealth Court Judge Anne Covey and Superior Court Judge Cheryl Allen , both Republicans. Covey reported having $37,000 at the end of the first quarter. Allen reported a $10,000 loan from a supporter that left her with $5,000 in the bank.
Democrat David Wecht, a Superior Court judge, had yet to file his latest report, but had an advantage with $279,000 on hand at the end of 2014. His campaign also had $135,000 in debt.
