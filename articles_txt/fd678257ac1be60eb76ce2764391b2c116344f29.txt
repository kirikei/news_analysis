AUDIO: Remembering Sarah Brady
Sarah Brady is being remembered for her tireless efforts in support of gun control, which helped lead to the Brady Bill that restricted the sale of handguns to fugitives, convicted felons and others who are deemed a threat.
Sarah Brady died Friday at the age of 73, months after her husband James Brady - who was shot in the head during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan - also died.
