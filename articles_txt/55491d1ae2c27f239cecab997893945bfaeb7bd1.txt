BOSTON, MA - The Patriots recently brought back Brandon Spikes to provide some depth behind inside linebackers Dont’a Hightower and Jerod Mayo and Spikes won’t be the only linebacker making his return to New England after playing elsewhere in 2014.
Mike Reiss of ESPNBoston.com reports that Bozeman native and former Montana State football player Dane Fletcher is in Foxboro for the start of the Patriots’ organized team activities on Tuesday and Ian Rapoport of NFL Media reports that he’ll sign a one-year deal to kick off his second stint with the team.
Fletcher made the Pats as an undrafted free agent in 2010 on the back of his special teams work and remained an integral member of those units for the team through the 2013 season. Fletcher also made six starts on defense in New England and made four more with the Buccaneers in 2014 after joining the team as a free agent last offseason.
Hightower is coming off shoulder surgery and Mayo tore his patellar tendon last season, so the Patriots are wise to give themselves some options in the event of further medical concerns. Doing it by bringing on players familiar to the coaching staff should make it a little less worrisome to turn to Spikes and Fletcher if the need arises.
