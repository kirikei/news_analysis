Stewart, appearing surprised by the city’s decision to give Emanuel a second chance, questioned the mayor's track record and campaign strategy in his latest segment "The Midwest Wing."
“Back in the day Chicago was a seedy hotbed of violence, financial ruin, and blatant crimes against humanity,” Stewart said as a picture of deep dish pizza appeared on the screen. “And by back in the day I mean 2011.”
(The pizza jab is a reference to an earlier battle between Stewart and Chicago where he berated the city’s iconic cheese-covered meal.)
He then references an increase in shootings and a $2 billion budget deficit.
“Things are looking up,” he said. “And by things, I mean the money they don’t have and crime.”
The mayor found himself battling for a second term in the city’s first-ever runoff election this month, ultimately beating out his challenger Jesus “Chuy” Garcia.
“How would a sitting mayor with a terrible record and a universally recognized abrasive personality defeat this country’s fourth most famous ‘Chuy’?” Stewart said.
The answer—with his campaign ads acknowledging his personality flaws.
“Chicago congratulations, you Rolling Stoned that s---,” Stewart said. “The report is in on everything you have done wrong and we feel that that report is punishment enough.”
