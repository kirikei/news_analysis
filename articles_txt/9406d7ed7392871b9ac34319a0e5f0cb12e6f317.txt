The 68th World Health Assembly wrapped up on Tuesday, with a series of decisions made to reform World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency response.
After eight days of sessions, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan hailed that the assembly had passed several "landmark resolutions and decisions."
Over 3,000 delegates from 194 member states welcomed WHO's commitment to deepening reforms of its emergency work, in particular by setting out clear and effective command and control mechanisms across all three levels of the organization - headquarters, regional and country offices.
WHO will set up a 100-million US dollars contingency fund to provide financing for in-field operations for up to three months. The contingency fund will run initially as a two-year pilot and will then be evaluated.
In addition, the assembly approved the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance, global vaccine action plan, air pollution strategy and other core health-related resolutions.
As the supreme decision-making body of WHO, the assembly is held annually in Geneva, Switzerland.
