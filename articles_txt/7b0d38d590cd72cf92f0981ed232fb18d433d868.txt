Get-out-the-vote effort in Ferguson - WGEM.com: Quincy News, Weather, Sports, and Radio
FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) - Ferguson's municipal election is Tuesday, and the Congressional Black Caucus is encouraging people to get out and vote.
Just 12 percent of Ferguson's voters went to the polls in the municipal election last April. This year, three of the six city council seats are up for grabs..
A massive effort sought to register more voters after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, who was black, by a white police officer in August. Officer Darren Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing but the shooting raised racial concerns in Ferguson, including the fact that just one member of the city council is black. That councilman, Dwayne James, is not up for re-election.
KMOV-TV ( http://bit.ly/1NWYWFh ) reports that Congressman William Lacy Clay of St. Louis went door-to-door over the weekend reminding people to vote.
