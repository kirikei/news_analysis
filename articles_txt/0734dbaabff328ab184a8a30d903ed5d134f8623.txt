Under the proposed deal, SFX would be acquired by an affiliate of Sillerman, who announced his original bid of $4.74 per share in February. The deal received unanimous approval by the special committee.
 
SFX is a major player on the rise and future of EDM. Its initial public stock offering in October 2013 raised $260 million  by selling 20 million shares at $13 per share.
 
The company's performance hasn't matched pre-IPO expectations, however. Its shares closed 16.5 percent below the $13 IPO price on the first day of trading. Quarterly and annual earnings have shown SFX to be a work in progress.
