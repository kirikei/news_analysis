Announcement:
Moody's: Controlling costs a challenge for Spanish regions as economy normalises
Global Credit Research - 27 May 2015
London, 27 May 2015 -- Improving economic prospects will likely help increase revenue generation  for Spanish regions, but also raises the long-term risk of  expenditure deviation, says Moody's Public Sector Europe in  a report published today.
Moody's Public Sector Europe is a new credit rating agency and the first  of its kind dedicated to the growing European public sector debt market.  It combines tailored service and local expertise with global reach,  using Moody's rigorous ratings methodologies to assign globally comparable  ratings.
The report, entitled 'Spanish Regions: Controlling costs  a challenge for newly-elected officials as economy normalises'  is now available on www.moodys.com. Moody's subscribers  can access this report via the link provided at the end of this press  release.
"The arrival of representatives in 13 Spanish regions coincides  with an improvement in economic conditions, a consequent increase  in revenue generation, and will reap the benefits of structural  reforms. However, the new regional administrations face pressure  to increase spending on healthcare, education, capital expenditure  and civil service pay, which could have an impact on expenditure  plans," says Marisol Blazquez, the Moody's analyst  for Spanish regions.
According to research by Moody's Public Sector Europe, Spain's  improving economic prospects will help regional fiscal consolidation.  Accelerating economic growth should gradually increase the regions'  tax revenues and central government transfers, helping them reduce  deficits and debt growth. The rating agency forecasts economic  growth of 2.7% and 2.2% in 2015 and 2016,  respectively.
In addition, Spanish regions will likely benefit from receiving  a higher portion of shared taxes (PIT, VAT and Special taxes) under  a reform of the regional funding system that will take place under the  next national legislature, says Moody's Public Sector Europe.
However, the rating agency expects public investment to rise again,  and healthcare spending to increase due to the growing elderly population  and increasing pharmaceutical costs as new medicines are launched.  Meanwhile, civil service unions are likely to push for a reversal  of salary freezes and job losses that took effect in the wake of the 2008  economic crisis.
In addition, Moody's Public Sector Europe notes that based  on 2015 initial budgets, education costs are now rising once again.
