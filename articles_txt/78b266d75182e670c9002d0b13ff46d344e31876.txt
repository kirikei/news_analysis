TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - A bill to help Florida’s craft brewing industry and allow sales of popular 64-ounce growlers of beer is hitting a snag in the Florida House.
But backers say they can work through the problems and pass the bill.
Senate Bill 186 appeared ready to pass its final committee stop in the House Regulatory Affairs Committee last week when a substitute bill proposed by the committee popped up. It included provisions craft brewers won’t accept. When they objected, consideration was postponed.
Tampa Republican Rep. Dana Young is leading the fight for the craft brewers. She says there’s still time in the session to solve the problem, and she’s optimistic an agreement can be reached.
The bill has passed its Senate committees and is heading to the Senate floor.
