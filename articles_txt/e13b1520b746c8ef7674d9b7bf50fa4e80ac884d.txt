Congresswoman Lois Capps, D-Calif., announced Wednesday she will not run for re-election in 2016 after representing California's 24th district for nearly twenty years.
In a video posted on her website, Capps said she believes it is time for her to return home to the community and family that she loves.
"It's been a hard decision to make, for I have loved this job," Capps said. "I have loved serving alongside such remarkable staff, such outstanding community members, and wonderful colleagues in public service."
She added, "But life moves on. And in the meantime I am very much looking forward to our final 22 months together in public office."
Capps has served in Congress since succeeding her husband Rep. Walter Capps in 1998 after he passed away less than one year into his term.
Political observers have suggested that the seat could remain in the family, as the Congresswoman's daughter Laura is said to be weighing the possibility of running to succeed her mother.
Capps represents a Democratic-leaning district, although the National Republican Congressional Committee said her retirement makes the seat a more likely pick-up opportunity for the GOP.
