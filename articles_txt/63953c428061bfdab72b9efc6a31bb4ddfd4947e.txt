April 7 (Reuters) - Residents in Ferguson, Missouri, are  casting their votes on Tuesday in a closely watched election  some see as a critical step toward ending discriminatory  practices detailed in a federal probe of the St. Louis suburb,  which was wracked by months of racially charged protests.
Three seats are up for election on the six-member City  Council in Ferguson, where two-thirds of the residents are  African-American and the municipal leadership has been long  dominated by whites. None of the incumbents are running.
Community activists say a lack of adequate representation  for African-Americans in Ferguson has contributed to a range of  problems that were exposed when a white police officer killed an  unarmed black teenager in August.
Activists hope new City Council membership will change that,  and African-American representation is guaranteed to double to  two after Tuesday's election and could increase to three seats.  A history of low voter turnout has some worried.
"This is a step we need to get the city headed in the right  direction," said Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for  Ferguson Township who has been running a voter education  program. "But we are dealing with a community that doesn't  regularly vote."
Voter turnout in Ferguson for local elections historically  runs from 10 percent to 40 percent, according to St. Louis  County records, though voter registration was up about 4.6  percent in the past nine months to more than 12,000 voters.
The election follows a U.S. Justice Department investigation  that found broad racial bias in Ferguson's police force and  municipal court system. Ferguson's city manager, police chief  and municipal judge resigned in March after the Justice  Department released a scathing report describing the findings.
Ferguson was hit by months of protests including some  violence and looting after white officer Darren Wilson fatally  shot Michael Brown, 18, in a confrontation on Aug. 9. Protests  surged in November after a grand jury decided Wilson should not  be charged.
Ferguson, which has about 21,000 residents, has had only two  black council members in its history, including Councilman  Dwayne James, who is not up for re-election. Eight candidates  including four African-Americans are vying for the three seats.
Two African-American candidates are running in the ward  where Brown lived. Four candidates, two black and two white, are  seeking a second seat. The third seat is being contested by two  white candidates.     (Reporting by Carey Gillam in Kansas City, Missouri; Additional  reporting by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Eric Beech)
