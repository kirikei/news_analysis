Mitt Romney, who has been proven right about everything since losing the presidency in 2012, was also right about college basketball when he filled out his NCAA bracket this past March.
The former Massachusetts governor, famous for once assuming that a tall man he met was “in sport,” finished in the 99.9th percentile of the entire ESPN Tournament Challenge for March Madness. He picked six of the final eight teams correctly, all of the final four teams correctly, the two championship teams correctly and the champion correctly.
On Sunday, Romney explained the secret to the success of his bracketology.
“Well, you know, I looked at the capability of the team. I looked also at what I thought the attitude of the team would be -- overconfident versus challenging underdogs. And I looked at the experience of the coach. And all that together accounted for 10 percent of my success and 90 percent of luck,” he said in an interview with "Fox News Sunday."
Romney insisted he got no help from anyone else when he filled out his bracket. And then, he pulled a George Costanza.
“I’m not going to fill out another bracket. This was the high point. I’m retiring after some success,” said Romney.
