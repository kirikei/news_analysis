A Staten Island Walgreens manager fuming over getting passed over for a promotion got his revenge by swiping $100,000 worth of cigarettes over the course of a year, police sources said Friday.
But the butt head’s plot was foiled when he tried to make off with 300 packs of smokes Friday — only to trip over a road barrier and snap his leg in a klutzy getaway, the sources said.
Tony Nazario, 29, of Old Bridge, NJ, had been using a key to get into the store on Forest Avenue near Decker Avenue after-hours and swipe a total of at least 10,000 packs of smokes since January 2014, police sources said.
Cops snuffed out his 23-pack-a-day habit after the bumbling bandit stuffed 300 packs of cigarettes — including Newports, Salems and Mavericks — into two garbage bags at around 12:30 a.m. Friday, the sources said.
When police showed up, Nazario dropped the bags and ran, police sources said.
But his getaway moves were worse than a winded chain smoker. He tried to hop a road barrier, failed to clear it and shattered his leg, said law-enforcement sources.
Even as he lay in a pool of blood — with his shin bone poking out through his skin — he tried to fight off cops, refusing to be cuffed, police sources said.
Later he confessed to the cigarette scheme, telling officers he was mad at the company’s regional manager and had stolen the cigarettes to “get his,” according to police sources.
As he lay bleeding on the ground, he added, “I shouldn’t have ran.”
Nazario was rushed to Richmond University Medical Center with a compound fracture.
The disgruntled worker went to the Walgreens every Thursday night after it closed to raid it, police sources said.
He may have sold the packs of cheap cigarettes to delis, police sources said.
Cops were tipped off about the heist by another worker, police sources said.
Nazario was moved to Staten Island University Hospital to undergo surgery on Friday.
Workers at the Walgreens on Friday claimed they had no clue about the scheme.
Walgreens spokeswoman Emily Hartwig had no comment Friday.
“We would refer you to local police regarding this matter,” she said.
Nazario, who was charged with grand larceny and burglary, could not be reached for comment at the hospital Friday.
