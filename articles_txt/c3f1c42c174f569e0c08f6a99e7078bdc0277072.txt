DADE CITY â€” The Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay is a daddy.
Cornelius, a rhesus macaque who formerly roamed Tampa Bay and eluded capture for years, became a father when his mate Cora gave birth at Dade City's Wild Things, a 22-acre zoo in Pasco County that holds more than 250 animals, the zoo announced Saturday.
The zoo reported that the baby and Cora are doing fine. Calls to the zoo were not immediately returned.
Cornelius was caught Oct. 24, 2012 in a St. Petersburg neighborhood near Lake Maggiore after being shot with tranquilizer darts. His capture came about three weeks after he bit a 60-year-old woman outside her home.
That ended a four-year adventure for the macaque who garnered headlines and national publicity by eluding capture despite repeated sightings around Tampa Bay.
