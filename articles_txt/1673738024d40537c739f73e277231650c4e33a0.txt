May 26, 2015 7:00 PM
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Authorities say they have found no threat after inspecting an aircraft that was the subject of a phone threat at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday.
The incident unfolded at LAX after EVA Air Flight 12 from Taipei landed about 3:30 p.m.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said officials with the Los Angeles Police Department, as well as airport police and police dogs trained to detect explosives inspected the jet, as well as passenger luggage.
“No threat to the aircraft was identified,” the FBI said in a written statement. “An investigation to determine individual or group responsible for the threat is ongoing.”
The plane landed at Gate 207, which according to CBS2’s Stu Mundel, is on the west-end of the airport.
Mundel said the LAPD had setup a command post and firefighters and officials with Homeland Security arrived on scene.
The nature of the threat was not disclosed, although the FBI had said: “All threats, regardless of known credibility, are taken seriously.”
Passengers on board the flight began to disembark just before 5:30 p.m. and were escorted to the Tom Bradley International Terminal, officials said.
No further information was available.
