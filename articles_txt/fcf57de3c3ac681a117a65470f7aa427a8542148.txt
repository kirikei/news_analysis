The sound of explosions and gunfire shook Kabul on Tuesday in what a police source described as an attack on a hotel owned by the son of Afghanistan's former President.
Fighting between militants and Afghan security forces raged for hours, starting around 11 p.m. and continuing into the early morning.
A police source told CNN the target was the Heetal Plaza Hotel, owned by the son of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani. But the hotel's manager said the hotel was not the target and had not been breached.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the group, said on Twitter that the hotel was targeted because foreign invaders were staying in it.
