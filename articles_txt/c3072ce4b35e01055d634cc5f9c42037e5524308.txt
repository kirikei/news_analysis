(CBS Connecticut) –– New London, Windham and Tolland Counties and the Mohegan and Mashantucket Tribal Nations will be able to recover some of the costs incurred in the January blizzard.  Governor Malloy announced late this afternoon that President Obama had approved the aid request for costs resulting from the January 26-28 storm.
Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman,  a Tolland resident, says even though the storm is over, “in Tolland County and many other communities throught the state,  rebuilding is still underway.”
The federal reimbursement rate of 75% will apply to eligible costs incurred as a result of the storm by governments and some private nonprofit groups,  for emergency work and repair or replacement of building damage.  Snow removal costs for the two days around the blizzard also are eligible.
