DeMarre Carroll had a sprained knee and turf toe, injuries that would’ve sidelined him for three to four weeks during the season. (Curtis Compton, ccompton@ajc.com)
By now you know the Hawks were drilled in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals 118-88 Tuesday night and were swept out of the series by the Cleveland Cavaliers. To go to MyAJC and read the column on the game, click here.
Here are my three “Short Takes” on the game.
1. THE REAL STORY ON CARROLL’S INJURY: DeMarre Carroll was ineffective at both ends of the court in the series because the Hawks said he was playing on a sprained knee. In fact, the situation was worse than that. Carroll told the AJC he also developed turf toe so he could not put any pressure on his left leg or get any elevation. “That’s why I kept getting shots blocked,” he said. If the injuries had taken place during the regular season, Carroll said, he probably would have sat out three to four weeks. But surgery will not be necessary. Carroll will become an unrestricted free agent but left the door to a return to the Hawks, pending negotiations with them and other teams.
2. SHOOTING WOES: The Hawks’ three-point shooting continued to suffer Tuesday night. They were only 5-for-32 (15.6 percent) from outside the arc in Game 4, 26-for-111 (23.4 percent) in the series and 145-for-458 in the postseason (.317). This was one of the top three-point shooting teams during the season at 38 percent, led by Kyle Korver’s 49.2 percent. But Korver hit on only 35.5 percent in the playoffs before he got injured in Game 2.

Hawks choke in 2 home games, in the playoffs, in games with 2 starters out on the opposing teams
Hawks lie about the severity of an injury to a starter for NO REASON AT ALL, then look like dumb arses when a teammate reveals it, and automatically alienate that player because he spoke the truth
The Hawks have the best record in their conference, home field advantage, and choke it away just like the Falcons did against Green Bay AND the NY Giants...the only teams that kick butt for homefield yet when the playoffs start, choke away all the toughness and good comments from others they earned by choking when it matters most
Beat writers stating that antic needs to be retained...are you kidding? Sefolosha needs to get healthy and they need to sign a true center that can rebound, or they won't make it back to the finals, EVER.
