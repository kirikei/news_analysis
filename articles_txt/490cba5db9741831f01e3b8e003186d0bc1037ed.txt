Bill introduced to allow terminally-ill people to end their lives with prescription drugs
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  
PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island — Lawmakers will consider whether to allow terminally-ill people to end their lives with prescription drugs.
Sen. Gayle Goldin and Rep. Edith Ajello introduced legislation that would guarantee a terminal patient's right to manage their own death if certain criteria are met, including two documented oral requests by the patient to a physician for the medication and a second medical opinion.
They've named their bill in honor of Lila Sapinsley, the state's first female Senate minority leader. They say Sapinsley was working on a similar right-to-die bill before she died last year at the age of 92.
Goldin, a Democrat from Providence, said she's honoring Sapinsley's final request.
A House committee will consider the measure Wednesday.
Only five states have made it legal for terminally-ill people to hasten their deaths.
