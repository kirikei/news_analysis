Snapchat co-founder and chief Evan Spiegel said Tuesday he has a plan for an initial public offering and has no desire to field any acquisitions offers, like Facebook ’s $3 billion bid for the company nearly two years ago.
Spiegel’s comments, coming at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., were the first time he has publicly acknowledged the possibility of an IPO. He stopped short of saying when the company, most recently valued at $15 billion, might try to go public.
After four years, Snapchat now ranks among the most popular social-networking services in the world. Spiegel revealed Tuesday the company is approaching 100 million users logging in every day.
Spiegel added more than 65% of daily users are creating content on the app.
Snapchat has never disclosed an official count of its users. As recently as last August, the service counted more than 100 million users in total, including those who do not log on every day, people close the company told The Wall Street Journal at that time.
Social networking leader Facebook had 936 million daily users on average in March, and Twitter recently said close to half of its 300 million monthly users log on to the social site every day.
Spiegel is touting the size of Snapchat as he hopes to drum up interest from advertisers. The company has in recent months begun selling ads, the startup’s first stream of revenue, and will eventually launch a self-serve ad product, Spiegel said.
The company will eventually develop sources of revenue beyond selling ads, the CEO said. “Great businesses” have multiple forms of revenue, he said.
Snapchat has worked to turn its free messaging app into a moneymaking business after raising more than $800 million from a diverse group of investors.
When asked about the current climate around tech investing, Spiegel said he predicts a “correction” is coming and he has factored that into his plans. He notes, like many observers of the recent boom in fundraising have, that low interest rates have spurred much of the activity.
With its appeal to teen users, Snapchat aims to go beyond messaging and become a next-generation media business, Spiegel said. The company has partnered with media brands including ESPN and Yahoo on its Discover service, which shows news articles and videos that disappear after one day.
Spiegel, a 24-year-old, first-time entrepreneur, was also asked about his management style. The CEO’s desire to have a hands-on role with the operation of the company contributed to the departure earlier this year of Emily White, a former Facebook executive who served as Snapchat’s chief operating officer for less than two years, people familiar with the matter said at the time.
