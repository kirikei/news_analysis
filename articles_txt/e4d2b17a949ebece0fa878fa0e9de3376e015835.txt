Calling Apple CEO Tim Cook a ‘Bigot’ draws Heavy on Fox Business News
Share this:
A Fox Business Network Commentator recently made a remark on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook when a regular guest called him a ‘bigot’. As a result, the commentator has come out in open with an apology for doing it. This incident happened in the Wednesday episode of “Imus in the morning” which is simulcast on Fox.
The temporary hosts of the show Dagen McDowell and Connell McShane drew a conversation with Bernard McGuick who was heard calling Tim Cook a ‘Bigot hypocrite’. The heavy word came out as a result of Cook’s take on the potentially discriminatory US State legislation.
The transcript that has been given to Business Insider reads McGuirk calling Cook a “Bigot Hypocrite”. This statement had been credited to Cook’s take against religious freedom laws which was expressed in a Washington Post Editorial and in his Twitter statements.
McGuirk stated, “He sells products to Iran, he sells products to Saudi Arabia, where they execute people if they’re gay.” He also expressed that Cook, “won’t allow these religious people to exercise their freedom,” and he also warned Cook about selling his products in countries namely Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Iran. According to McGuirk, these countries do not respect women and give them a second class citizen treatment. MMcGuirk said that these countries are harsh enough to execute Gay people.
After the incident, McDowell was heard on air apologizing for the event. She stated, “The Fox Business Network would like to make it clear that we in no way believe that [Cook is a bigot]. Mr. Cook runs a company that is an American success story and Apple has become a worldwide brand.”
This is not the first time that Cook has been accused of hypocricy which is a huge alarming sign for the American based company. However, the apology by Fox Network will ease the situation a little.
