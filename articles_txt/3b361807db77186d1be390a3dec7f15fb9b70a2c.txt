Tom Cotton said gay Americans should have “perspective” about discrimination.
“These laws are modeled on that and a lot of the concerns of discrimination haven’t been borne to bear over the last 20 years. But I also think it’s important that we have a sense of perspective about our priorities,” Cotton said . “In Iran they hang you for the crime of being gay.”
The senator’s remarks drew the attention of the outspoken pop star, Miley Cyrus, who called on her legions of fans to “stir some shit up” by calling Cotton’s Capitol Hill office:
“Senator Cotton thinks gay community needs to get ‘perspective’ cuz ‘In Iran they hang you for the crime of being gay,’” she tweeted on Thursday.
Miley Cyrus further tweeted:
“Let’s stir some shit up! Senator Cotton (202) 224-2353 !!!! Happy Hippies call & express why freedom is important to us & our country!”
The Huffington Post tried to reach Cotton’s office at the number Cyrus tweeted, but the call immediately went to a full voicemail box. Cotton’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this week, Miley Cyrus offered kudos to Apple CEO Tim Cook after Cook voiced his opposition to a similar bill in Arkansas. She tweeted:
“Thank yiew Tim Cook & Apple for standing up for equality! Thank you for keeping this country moving forward and evolving!”
