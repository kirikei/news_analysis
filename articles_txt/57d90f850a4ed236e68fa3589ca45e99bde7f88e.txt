Within minutes of her first tweets, Ms Manning had recruited more than 5,000 followers under the handle @xychelsea.
In her initial tweets, Ms Manning acknowledged she had no Internet access behind bars and that she was dictating comments to a communications company by telephone.
This is my new twitter account =P
I’m hoping to stay connected w/ this account as much as poss., but would rather tweet about more meaningful things than not #lessismore
Tweeting from prison reqs a lot of effort and using a voice phone to dictate #90sproblems
It will be hard, but I don’t want this Twitter feed to be a one-way street/conversation
Also for those of you asking: @fitzgibbonmedia is handling my account for the time being
Ms Manning already writes occasional commentaries for The Guardian newspaper's American edition, offering her take on US foreign policy.
The former army intelligence analyst was convicted in August 2013 of espionage and other offenses after admitting to handing over more than 700,000 classified documents, including military intelligence reports and State Department cables, to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
US officials describe the document dump as the biggest leak of classified files in American history.
Ms Manning, who was formerly a male enlistee known as Bradley Manning , is serving out her sentence at Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas.
