More transportation options may open up at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport as early as June of this year.
The Port Of Seattle has reportedly been in negotiation with Uber, Lyft and Sidecar to provide rides leaving Sea-Tac airport.
All three companies have requested access to airport property in order to pick up passengers.
Lyft, Sidecar, and uberX are all “transportation network companies” - otherwise called TNCs – that are currently prohibited from picking up passengers at the airport due to existing taxi regulations that only permit Yellow Cab to pick up arriving travelers.
Yellow Cab’s exclusive five-year contract expires this October, opening the door for TNC pick-ups at the airport.
A memo from the Port of Seattle “anticipates” the pick-ups to start in June or July. The memo notes that Yellow Cab pays Sea-Tac upward of $3.67 million  annually – equal to 13 percent of its gross revenue from airport pickups.
