Washington Governor Jay Inslee (D) has reversed his decision over a travel ban to Indiana he set in place Monday following Gov. Mike Pence (R) signing a “Religious Freedom” law that many say would allow business to discriminate against gays and lesbians.
On Friday, Indiana Gov. Pence signed legislation that has amended the law which rescinded much of the elements that would allow discrimination.
Fierce backlash politically and threats of boycotts from high profile corporations, including the NCAA forced him to backtrack on Monday’s legislation.
Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy has not withdrew his ban on tax-payer funded travel to Indiana as of yet.
