SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — President Barack Obama's visit to Utah isn't just the first time he's been to the state while in office. It's also the latest stop on his tour of Republican "red" states.
Obama has traveled to 10 Republican states since the GOP took control of both houses of Congress in January.
He has visited nine states that voted to give him a second term.
The White House says there is no concerted effort to put Obama in Republican states.
