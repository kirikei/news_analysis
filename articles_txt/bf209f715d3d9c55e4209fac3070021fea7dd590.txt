SACRAMENTO (KRON) — One of the 83 people pardoned by Governor Jerry Brown Sunday is San Francisco resident Eddy Zheng.
Since being imprisoned for burglary, robbery, false imprisonment with violence, robbery in an inhabited house and kidnapping to commit robbery, Zheng has done extensive community work in San Francisco.
Zheng’s pardon says that since his release from prison, “he has lived an honest and upright life, exhibited good moral character, and conducted himself as a law abiding citizen.”
He is now a project director at the Community Youth Center of San Francisco.
He also volunteers his time on several commissions and councils within the city, including the San Francisco Reentry Council and the Central Police Station’s Community Police Advisory Board.
According to the pardon, Zheng has conducted more than 200 anti-violence presentations and workshops at schools and public events.
Zheng served 24 years in prison, from 1986 until 2010.
The pardon says because he completed his sentence and because of his good conduct since his release, Zheng “has paid his debt to society and earned a full and unconditional pardon.”
