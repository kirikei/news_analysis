Serena Williams is still being troubled by her elbow injury despite a straight-sets victory over Andrea Hlavackova on Tuesday at the French Open.
The world No. 1Â withdrew in Rome due to the injury but it mattered little Tuesday as she crushed Czech Republic's Hlavackova 6-2 6-3 at Roland Garros.

"I was really happy to see how my elbow was going to do," the 19-time grand slam champion said.Â "It's not 100 percent but I was able to serve OK, I didn't serve as many aces as I usually do.Â I think it gets better every day, so another day off and then hopefully if I can win another round it will be better."
Williams, who faces German Anna-Lena Friedsam in the second round, also took time during her media conference to praise Andy Murray.
The 33-year-old lauded the Scot for his support of the women's game, even suggesting he made her feel bad.
"I mean, obviously Andy Murray goes out of his way, is so positive with women players and doesn't play favorites," Williams said.Â "He is always watching women's tennis. He watches more than I do and makes me feel bad. So I think that is inspiring.
"And also he really is pro-women, he goes all out for (coach)Â Amelie Mauresmo. Hiring her, I thought, was really awesome."
