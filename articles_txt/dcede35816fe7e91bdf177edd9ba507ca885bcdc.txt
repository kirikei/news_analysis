HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) â€” The celebration of UConn's 10th women's basketball championship continues this weekend with a parade through Hartford.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's office says the victory parade will begin at 3 p.m. Sunday at the state Capitol and end at the XL Center, the downtown basketball arena, where a rally is planned.
It's a much shorter route than in previous years, when the parade would wind through city streets and end back at the Capitol.
An estimated 200,000 people showed up last year for a parade that celebrated dual championships of the UConn men's and women's basketball teams.
Malloy's office says that as in previous years, organizers are soliciting donations from local businesses to pay for the parade.
