LG G4 Release Date News: Price And Availability Details Announced
The LG G4 won’t be available at most carriers until June, but those looking to purchase LG’s latest flagship can get the rundown on its price and availability right now.
LG G4 is expected to contend with the Samsung Galaxy S6 on the market, largely because of its removable back panel and its 16-megapixel rear camera. The removable back panel will allow users to remove and change the device’s battery. It will also let users install extra internal storage with a MicroSD card. This feature was removed from the Galaxy S6 in exchange for a more premium metal and glass unibody design. However, many Samsung fans have complained about the lack of MicroSD expansion on the Galaxy S6.
LG hopes to snatch some of Samsung’s unsatisfied followers , and has outfitted the LG G4 with a genuine leather back panel as a premium design option. Other, non-leather design options include metallic gray, ceramic white and shiny gold. 
To capitalize on the competition with Samsung, LG is offering the LG G4 in a bundle that includes a 32GB MicroSD card, an extra 3,000mAh battery and a battery-charging cradle.
Other hardware features on the LG G4 include a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 chip, 3GB of RAM memory and 32GB of internal storage, as well as a 3,000mAh battery.
