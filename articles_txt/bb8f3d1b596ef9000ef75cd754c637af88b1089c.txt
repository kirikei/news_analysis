You'll never believe who taught Malia Obama how to drive!
In a new interview with Rachael Ray (airing April 9), first lady Michelle Obama revealed she hasn't been behind the wheel of a car since before moving into the White House. "When was the last time you actually got to drive a car?" Ray asked Barack Obama 's other half.
"It's been seven or eight years," Michelle answered.
"I heard Malia has her license, is that true? Who taught her?" Ray added.
"The Secret Service, actually, because they wouldn't let me in the car with her," Michelle explained. "Driving for Malia, I think, gives her a sense of normalcy, like the rest of her friends are doing. And my kids have got to learn how to live in the world like normal kids."
Michelle says driving is actually one of the things she's most looking forward to doing after her husband's presidency ends. "You know, I was joking the other day, I just want to ride around in a car with the window open. It's just like, I want to do that," she laughed.
As for how her family stays so grounded, Michelle dished, "Being president doesn't change who you are. It makes who you are more of that. If you come in grounded, you're going to leave grounded. If you come in a little, sort of, off-kilter, that's just going to be magnified. My hope is just to make sure that that they come out of this thing as functioning adults, you know?"
