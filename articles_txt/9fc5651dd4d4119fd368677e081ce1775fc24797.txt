NEW CASTLE, N.H. (AP) - A ship from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has accidentally discharged oily water into the Piscataqua River.
The Coast Guard says the Ferdinand R. Hassler discharged the water overboard while at its moorings in New Castle on Tuesday.
Agencies, including the state Department of Environmental Services and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, sent personnel and equipment to the scene. The Coast Guard says at least one vessel anchored nearby appears to have been affected by the oil. There have been no reports of pollution on shore or damage to wildlife.
NOAA spokesman David L. Hall said the NOAA is investigating the incident to prevent it from happening again. He added that “any amount spilled is too much.”
