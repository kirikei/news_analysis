Buff’s Civil War campaign nears end after 65 battlefields
April 4, 2015
Rob Orrison’s love and interest in the American Civil War has been a huge influence in his life. This interest has seen him visit over 60 civil war battlefields as well as participating in the commemoration ceremonies.
Rob grew up in a small town called Leesburg, located in Virginia Washington. Washington’s proximity to some of the battlefield sites fueled his passion even more.
His interest in the history of the civil wars is his hobby. To rob, the hobby is as important as a marriage or as having a child. It, therefore, requires a lot of devotion. This hobby and the collective knowledge that Rob has collected from it has resulted into a part profession for him. This is because he occupies the position of historic sites operations supervisor for Northern Virginia’s Prince William County.
At the age of 39, Orrison has managed to visit almost all the battlefields. He started his epic journey in 2011. He is such a die-hard fan that he held his wedding day with his wife on the same day as the anniversary of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.
Orisson’s hobby has seen him travel thousands of grueling miles. It has also been a pricey hobby as he estimates that he has spent over $10,000 to finance his travels and souvenirs. Though he claims that at times his wife becomes impatient with this, he adds that there are far worse hobbies.
The civil war enthusiast boasts of having marched through almost every battlefield. He can name all of the grounds he has attended including the infamous Gettysburg. Orisson also explained that the civil war commemorations are a major tourist attraction for the various states. In his epic journeys, he has encountered countless others who share the same interest.
Orisson will complete his impressive march next week in the same place where the last civil war was held. He will be accompanied by his wife and two-year-old son.
