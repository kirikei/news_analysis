The IRS says more than 100,000 taxpayers have had their personal tax information stolen from an agency website.
Officials said the breach was part of an elaborate scheme to claim fraudulent tax refunds.
The information was stolen from an online system called "Get Transcript." The system allows taxpayers to get tax returns and other tax filings from previous years.
In order to access the information, the thieves cleared a security screen that required knowledge about the taxpayer, including Social Security number, date of birth, tax filing status and street address.
The IRS said it is notifying taxpayers whose information was accessed. The IRS is providing them with credit monitoring services.
The IRS has launched a criminal investigation. The agency's inspector general is also investigating.

IRS: Crooks Stole Data on 100K Taxpayers Via ‘Get Transcript’ Feature
In March 2015, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that identity thieves engaged in filing fraudulent tax refund requests with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were using the IRS’s own Web site to obtain taxpayer data needed to complete the phony requests. Today, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen acknowledged that crooks used this feature to pull sensitive data on more than 100,000 taxpayers this year.
That March story — Sign Up at IRS.gov Before Crooks Do It For You — tracked the nightmarish story of Michael Kasper, one of millions of Americans victimized by tax refund fraud each year. When Kasper tried to get a transcript of the fraudulent return using the “Get Transcript” function on IRS.gov, he learned that someone had already registered through the IRS’s site using his Social Security number and an unknown email address.
Koskinen was quoted today in an Associated Press story saying the IRS was alerted to the thieves when technicians noticed an increase in the number of taxpayers seeking transcripts. The story noted that the IRS said they targeted the system from February to mid-May, and that the service has been temporarily shut down. Prior to that shutdown, the IRS estimates that thieves used the data to steal up to $50 million in fraudulent refunds.
“In all, about 200,000 attempts were made from questionable email domains, with more than 100,000 of those attempts successfully clearing authentication hurdles,” the IRS said in a statement . “During this filing season, taxpayers successfully and safely downloaded a total of approximately 23 million transcripts.”
SCOURGE AT THE STATE LEVEL
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates that thieves steal nearly $6 billion a year from state and federal coffers each year via tax refund fraud. This year, fraudsters changed their tactics, leading to a huge spike in attempted fraudulent refund requests — particularly at the state level .
Earlier this week, I had an opportunity to interview John Valentine, chair of the Utah State Tax Commission. Valentine said this year his state saw a tenfold increase in suspicious tax refund filings, and that most of that increase was the result of a type of tax fraud the state had never seen before.
“This was unique, where someone clearly had the information from the prior year’s tax return,” Valentine said. “That different significantly from the way the return comes across if it’s just ID theft. If you have the prior year’s return, you have the names of children, their Social Security numbers and other data you don’t often times get with ID theft.”
These suspicious returns all had the filing status exactly the same [as the year prior], the number of exemptions exactly the same….you even got spelling errors on addresses and names, so that the same errors that occurred in the 2013 return occurred in the fraudulent 2014 return,” Valentine explained. “That’s what told us we were dealing with a different kind of fraud, especially since the extent of the fraud was ten times the amount of fraud we’d seen in the past.”
Valentine said he believes most of that increase was due to lax authentication and security at third-party tax preparation firms (TurboTax, for example). Based on numerous stories about poor authentication and virtually nonexistent “know-your-customer” procedures at TurboTax , I’ve no doubt the nation’s leading tax preparation firm contributed considerably to the spike. But that same data that Valentine references also could be had by pulling taxpayer data from the IRS’s site, which until very recently offered the full previous year’s W2 information on taxpayers.
Stay tuned over the next week for more in-depth stories and interviews about how the states are grappling with tax return fraud, and the changes they are seeking to the status quo.

Let’s hope that the spike was because of Brian’s “Sign Up at IRS.gov Before Crooks Do It For You” article.
I know I followed his advice; it was shockingly easy. I still can’t believe they delegated the Q&A to a credit report agency, instead of just asking for last year’s Adjusted Gross Income, or something like that.
Wondering if the IRS is now going to contact me to tell me that my information may have been stolen…
This year was the last straw for Intuit software. I deleted it all — Quicken, Turbotax — after Intuit made you upload your sensitive, private financial information to Intuit’s servers just to create a PDF of your return.
“You may save your return as a PDF file and understand it may be processed on Intuit servers, not as part of the Software.”
Strange that your username is a competitor of Intuit called H&R Block.
Did you know that company outsources some of their clients’ tax return work to India ?
This site brags about it (proceed at your own risk)
hxxp://www.outsource2india.com/financial/hr-block-tax-cut-processing.asp
And have you heard of the enormous number of scammer calls posted on various telephone-number-report websites, where the poster says the person who called had a strong accent that made them sound like a person in India? And the calls were threatening the poster with arrest by the IRS?
Just use any search engine with the words
H&R Block outsource India
So many weakness in the entire process..
The insanity of being asked to provide your social security number on your check used to pay taxes owed giving a “handler” 100% of the necessary data to own an identity..
Now this tabacle.. Any ideas if they’ve though about notifying the +100k identities that were accessed when their “technicians” recognized the surge in inquiries?
Perhaps they will actually work on shoring up the gaps in this system.. not likely but a taxpayer can hope!!
Using the wrong authenticators is no better than not authenticating. Secret questions of easily determined info doesn’t work.
Too easy for the IRS to do something similar?
A huge number of people move every year in the USA.
Remember, we have over 300,000,000 people in the USA. That’s more than 12 times as many people as Australia.
This means a lot of IRS mail never gets delivered because the recipients can’t be found. And some IRS mail has DO NOT FORWARD on the envelopes.
Australia has less than 24 million people. For comparison, the second-most-populated state in the US is Texas with more than 28 million, and an unknown millions of illegal aliens from countries south of the Rio Grande. And the people who control the state government do not want any state income tax on its residents.
Common mistake:  They don’t steal YOUR refund. The file a bogus claim and can claim a refund even if you owe them money.
So the good news: You will get yours, and if you had a refund last year can still get that one.
The bad news is that it will get delayed and causes you extra paperwork. But the thieves never ever get your money. (Except of course we taxpayers jointly pay for the fraud.)
My son, after hours on the phone over a few days was told that yes he was a victim of identity theft at the IRS, that he was on the task force list who had six months to reply, would probably take that long, and that further information from him (he is still getting requests about questions, forms, requests he didn’t make) would be futile so don’t bother. It is being taken care of! Money was given the thief, but his large refund is in limbo with all inquiries refused. TurboTax is where his troubles started.
Additionally he got questions from Social Security about questions and forms he had not requested. When contacting the local office he was told it was just an error, not to worry, and do not register until he is 65. Hard to believe, but true.
