MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A bill proposed in the Alabama Legislature could end up banning most abortions if approved, although prospects for passage this year are uncertain.
Republican Rep. Terri Collins of Decatur has proposed legislation to prohibit abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Collins says if the end of life is defined by the absence of a heartbeat, it makes sense to her to define the beginning of life with the start of a heartbeat.
A spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood calls the bill "dangerous and blatantly unconstitutional."
Nikema Williams of Planned Parenthood Southeast says the bill would ban abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before a woman might know she's pregnant.
A federal judge last year ruled a similar North Dakota law unconstitutional.
