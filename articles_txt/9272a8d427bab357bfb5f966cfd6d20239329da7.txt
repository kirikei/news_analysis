COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) — A museum in upstate New York is commemorating the 150 anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's death with a display of items related to his assassination, including autopsy notes.
The artifacts that went on display April 5 at the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown are from its own collection. They're related to the assassination of Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C.C, on April 14, 1865.
The items include handwritten notes from two physicians, Dr. Joseph Woodward and Dr. Robert King Stone. The two Army surgeons performed Lincoln's autopsy after the 16th president died the morning after being shot during a performance of “Our American Cousin."
The new exhibit, “Autopsy for a Nation: The Death of Abraham Lincoln," runs through Dec. 31.
