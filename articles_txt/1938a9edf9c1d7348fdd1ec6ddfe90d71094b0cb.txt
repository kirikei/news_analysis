Texas state senators on Monday began debating a bill that would overturn the law allowing the children of undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public universities and colleges.
Democrats are defending the law approved in 2001, but Republicans, who enjoy big majorities in both legislative chambers, have promised to nullify it.
The bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Donna Campbell, said Monday that in-state tuition should be available only to students living in the state legally, while detractors say that her proposal is racist and discriminatory.
Repeal of the law would force Texas residents whose parents are undocumented to pay tuition at the much higher out-of-state rate.
In 2001, the law had the support of both parties and was signed by then-Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, making Texas the first of about 20 states to implement similar rules over the past decade.
However, a new generation of Republican lawmakers, some of them closely linked with the Tea Party, have been elected in recent years and have adopted intransigent stances on immigration.
In 2012, when Perry launched his presidential bid, he still defended the law during a debate with other candidates.
Before it can be overturned, the law's opponents must win several votes in the coming months in both the state Senate and House of Representatives.
The state Senate is currently comprised of 20 Republicans and 11 Democrats, while the lower chamber contains 98 Republicans and 52 Democrats. EFE
