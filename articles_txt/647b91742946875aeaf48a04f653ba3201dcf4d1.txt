Ride share bill raises discrimination concerns
Some state lawmakers are raising concerns that ride share companies could discriminate against customers.
They're considering a bill that would have a state agency oversee services like Uber and Lyft.
Robert Kellman of Uber's Midwest office in Chicago says they have an anti-discrimination policy in place. He says drivers are forced to follow it.
Democratic Rep. Lisa Subeck of Madison says she believes there's the potential for discrimination, because drivers can refuse to provide rides.
An Assembly committee held a public hearing on statewide rules for ride share companies yesterday. The bill would preempt any local regulations.
