Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, one of the GOP&#8217s talked-about candidates for president in 2016, says it&#8217s good to have tolerance for homosexuals, but America requirements to be cautious not to create a unique class of persons with particular legal rights.
&#8220The great news is our society is moving in a path of much more tolerance,” he mentioned, Mediaite reported. &#8220My concern about creating particular legal protections is historically in our nation, we have only completed that in extraordinary circumstances. It doesn&#8217t seem to me we&#8217re in 1 of those moments right now.”

Jindal and state legislators are mulling over a provision that&#8217s comparable to what Indiana passed, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. But critics contact such bills discriminatory against gays – though supporters say the measures only reinforce what the Initial Amendment protects.
Jindal didn&#8217t speak directly to the specifics of his state&#8217s forthcoming bill. But he cautioned critics to tread very carefully.
&#8220I have faith and self-confidence in the people in America and the people of New Orleans and the men and women of Louisiana to not tolerate discrimination, to not support organizations that want to help discrimination,” he said. &#8220So absolutely we have to have to have a society exactly where we&#8217re not discriminating against persons. I do assume we need to have to be incredibly careful about making specific rights.”
