Schieffer, who has hosted “Face the Nation” since 1991, has not named a specific date for his retirement yet.
Dickerson has been a frequent contributor to "Face the Nation," appearing on the show 83 times.
"John is first and foremost a reporter-and that's what he'll be as anchor of Face the Nation," said CBS News President David Rhodes in a statement.

He has earned the respect of newsmakers across the political spectrum."
