LAS VEGAS — A failed soccer stadium bid is at the heart of a challenge to unseat Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman.
Voters in Las Vegas went to polls Tuesday to decide if the wife of former-mayor and attorney Oscar Goodman should be re-elected to another four-year term or if her challenger on the city council Stavros Anthony should take the top spot.
Anthony is a former Las Vegas police captain serving a second council term.
Goodman backed a partly publicly-funded downtown soccer stadium. Anthony has argued it shouldn't involve public funds. The deal ultimately failed.
Four people are running for mayor. The top two vote-getters will face a runoff in June unless one gets 50 percent of the vote plus one.
The City of Las Vegas doesn't include the Las Vegas Strip.
