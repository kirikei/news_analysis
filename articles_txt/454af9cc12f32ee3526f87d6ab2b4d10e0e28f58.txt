A member of the Uniformed Division of Secret Service was arrested Friday by the DC Metropolitan Police Department, a law enforcement official tells CNN, and will be charged with one misdemeanor count for destruction of property.
According to U.S. Secret Service Spokesman Brian Leary, "an off duty USSS Uniformed Division Officer assigned to Foreign Missions Branch was arrested by the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C."
The officer has been placed on administrative leave, and his security clearance has been suspended by the director of the Secret Service, Joseph Clancy.
The incident comes as the Secret Service is trying to mend its reputation after numerous issues concerning the discipline and professionalism of its officers have come to light recently.
More specifics on this incident were not yet available. Leary also told CNN that the Secret Service's "Office of Professional Responsibility will investigate this matter."
