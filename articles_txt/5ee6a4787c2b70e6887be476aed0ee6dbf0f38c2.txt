Forbes has released its list of the most powerful women in the world, and aged just 25, Taylor Swift has become the youngest woman to be included in the list.
At the tender age of just 25, it is quite some feat for Taylor Swift to be included in the list among the likes of Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama.
Whilst there are some political leaders and entrepreneurs included in the list, we have turned our attention to the celebrity role models.
Beyonce has become the highest ranking musician on the list at number 21. Aged 33, Beyonce has dropped down the list slightly after being named the seventeenth most powerful women last year.
Elsewhere, Modern Family actress Sofia Vergara has also made the list. Whilst Taylor Swift may only be at number 64, she has been recognised due to donating a five figure sum to the New York City Department of Education from the sales of single, ‘Welcome to New York’. She also promises to continue to give as long as the song keeps on selling.
Angelina Jolie, Shakira, and Yao Chen are all included on the list as well.
Elsewhere, the fantastic Oprah Winfrey has also been named one of the most powerful women in the world as outside of her day job, she is also quite the advocate.
Oprah founded both Harbo Productions and The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa.
Do you think there are other celebrities who should have been recognised? Let us know in the comments below…
