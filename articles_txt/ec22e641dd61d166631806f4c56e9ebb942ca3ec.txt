Ramsey, Norris oppose Bible as official Tennessee book
NASHVILLE, Tenn. –A Senate committee in Nashville has approved a measure that would make the Bible the official state book of Tennessee.
You might think you know who in state government would be for this, but you might be wrong.
Two legislators from the Memphis areas are against the proposal.
Republican Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey opposes the bill saying it “belittles the most holy book ever written.”
Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, opposes the bill because he said under prior U.S Supreme Court ruling  that said any mention in the official sate law-book “must have a predominately secular effect.”
The bill is sponsored by two ordained ministers, Rep. Jerry Sexton, R- Bean Station and  Senator Steve Southerland, R-Morristown.
Both say their focus is not on religion but the role the Bible played in Tennessee history.
