Children attending Monday’s annual White House Easter Egg Roll also found themselves part of an impromptu birthday celebration for first lady Michelle Obama ’s signature “Let’s Move!” initiative.
The effort, which celebrated its fifth anniversary Monday, promotes exercise and healthy eating. Mrs. Obama also has used to the initiative to push controversial school-lunch standards in districts across the country.
Before children began hunting for Easter eggs on the White House lawn Monday, the president asked them to join in and wish “Let’s Move!” a happy birthday.
“This is always one of our favorite events. We hope you guys are having fun. This is a particularly special Easter Egg Roll because we’ve actually got a birthday to celebrate,” Mr. Obama said. “It is the fifth anniversary of the first lady’s ‘Let’s Move!’ initiative.”
Mrs. Obama encouraged attendees to use the hashtag #GimmeFive on Instagram, Twitter and elsewhere and list five ways they’re living a healthier lifestyle.
“Be a part of the movement … it’s a great way to get everybody moving,” she said.
