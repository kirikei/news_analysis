MSNBC’s Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough appeared on Hugh Hewitt ‘s radio show Friday afternoon, and we learned two things: 1) He’s open to a 2018 U.S. Senate run in Florida; and 2) He doesn’t think Hillary Clinton will win the 2016 presidential election.
“If Marco Rubio declares as we expect him to do to run for president next year, any chance Joe Scarborough wants to go to the Senate from Florida to replace him?” Hewitt asked the MSNBC personality.
“I don’t think in ’16, but who knows?” Scarborough replied. “In ’18, Bill Nelson’s up, and I don’t think Bill Nelson will be sticking around, so you know, one of these years, I think, one of these years if I did something, I’d probably look to run in Florida.”

And when the conversation turned to an increasingly likely Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, Scarborough predicted: 1) The email scandal is not enough to keep her out of the race; 2) She will win the Democratic Party’s nomination; and 3) She would would not win the general election.
“I think she has a glass jaw,” he said of the former Secretary of State. “And I’ll be really blunt: I don’t think she’s going to be the next president of the United States. Everybody acts like she’s inevitable. But I know a lot of people very close to Hillary Clinton that are very worried right now that she has what it takes to win a general election. [...] I’m actually feeling very bullish on 2016 right now if we [Republicans] nominate the right guy or woman.”
