Walkerton, Ind. • A crowdfunding campaign for an Indiana pizzeria that came under fire after its owners said their religious beliefs wouldn't allow them to cater a gay wedding has raised more than $840,000.
Memories Pizza in Walkerton is closed indefinitely and its operators say they've gone into hiding.
But a gofundme.com site benefiting the restaurant had raised more than $842,000 by Saturday morning.
The restaurant about 20 miles southwest of South Bend faced criticism after co-owner Crystal O'Connor expressed support for Indiana's new religious objections law, which legislators tweaked this week to address concerns that it would allow discrimination against gays and lesbians.
