COLUMBUS (AP) -- Monday is the deadline for Ohioans to register to vote for the May 5 primary and special election.
Secretary of State Jon Husted is reminding voters who have moved since the last election to update their voting address online at MyOhioVote.com. Voter registration forms also are available at that website or from local boards of elections and other agencies, such as libraries.
Primary voters will have a chance to cast their ballots for a number of local candidates and help to decide the outcome of 336 loca
l issues that include school and local tax levies, bond issues and charter amendments.
Absentee voting for the primary election will begin on Tuesday. Voted ballots must be postmarked the day before Election Day and received no later than May 15.
