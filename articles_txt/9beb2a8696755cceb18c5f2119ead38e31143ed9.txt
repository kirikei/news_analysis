Might Stephen Vogt find himself in his first All-Star Game this summer?

Major League Baseball released its first update regarding 2015 All-Star Game voting on Tuesday, and Oakland A's catcher Stephen Vogt is among the top vote-getters in the American League.
Other notable A's among the top vote-getters are shortstop Marcus Semien (third among shortstops with 354,954 votes) and outfielder Josh Reddick (11th among outfielders with 331,846 votes). 
Vogt is off to a tremendous start in 2015, heading into play Tuesday with a slash line of .307/.410/.598 to go along with ten home runs, 33 RBIs and a WAR of 2.2.
While it's unlikely he will surpass Perez and be elected the American League catcher for the All-Star Game (considering Royals fans have come out strong so far in casting votes for their players), he just may find himself in the Midsummer Classic as a reserve player if he's able to keep up this offensive pace.
Of course, fearless GM Billy Beane could also trade Vogt for younger players if the club is unable to dig itself out of last place in the A.L. West ( as has been discussed recently ). If, however, Beane holds onto Vogt, he could have a somewhat decent chance of making his first All-Star Game appearance later this summer.
