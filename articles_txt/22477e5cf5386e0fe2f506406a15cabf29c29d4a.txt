COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio’s lawmakers are considering a proposal that would bring a little bit of Bourbon Street to the Buckeye state.
The idea is to allow for entertainment districts similar to those in New Orleans and Memphis, Tennessee, where revelers could carry open containers of alcohol outside.
The proposal would put a limit of two entertainment districts in cities with at least 50,000 people. Cities with at least 35,000 could create one area where bar and restaurant customers could walk outside with open containers without breaking the law.
Customers could buy and drink alcohol within a designated half square mile. But they wouldn’t be permitted to bring their own drinks.
The proposal recently passed the House and is now awaiting a vote in the Senate.
