According to a new study, babies living at very high elevations could have more chances of suffering from an increased risk of SIDS. These findings have been concluded on the basis of study conducted on approximately 400,000 Colorado infants born between 2007 and 2012. It was found in the study that babies of families living at an elevation of 8,000 feet or more had more than double chances of getting SIDS compared to babies from families living below 6,000 feet.
SIDS was rare at even at higher altitudes, even with doubled odds. Nearly 0.8 deaths occurred for every 1,000 infants who lived at the highest elevations. According to researchers, the findings don't show that high altitudes in reality play a role in death of infants. However, they said that it's likely that the thinner air at those elevations contribute.
According to lead researcher Dr. David Katz, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Colorado, in Aurora, "This is a call for further research. We wouldn't advocate that people abandon higher elevations based on this study".
In addition to that he said that although infants living high in the mountains had a comparatively greater SIDS risk, it was still very low. Findings of the study have been published online in the journal Pediatrics.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year in the United States, nearly 3,500 infants die unexpectedly, from no clear cause. These deaths are mostly caused by SIDS. Experts launched public campaigns in the 1990s, so as to persuade parents to take use soft bedding, put their infants on their backs to sleep, and take other important steps.
According to background information in the study, after that deaths caused due to this decreased over 50%.
