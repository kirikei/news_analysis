WASHINGTON - The Secret Service has put a senior supervisor on leave and suspended his security clearance after an employee accused him of assaulting her after-hours at headquarters last week, the agency said Wednesday.
The Washington police's sex-crimes unit and a government inspector general are investigating the female agent's allegation that Xavier Morales, a manager in the security clearance division, made unwanted advances and grabbed her on March 31 after they returned from a party at a restaurant, said two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the probe.
The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales, her boss, told her during the party that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her, according to two people briefed on her statements. In the office later, she alleged, Morales tried to kiss her and grabbed her arms when she resisted, according to the two people briefed on her complaint. The woman alleged that they scuffled until Morales relented.
Through an agency spokesman, Morales declined to comment.
Late last week, the Secret Service took the unusual step of placing Morales on indefinite administrative leave and adding his name to an internal "do not admit" list prohibiting entry to the office, a Secret Service official said.
"The Secret Service is an agency that demands that our employees conduct themselves with the highest level of integrity. These allegations as reported are very disturbing," Director Joseph Clancy said in a statement to the Post.
Morales, 48, was among the first group of officials Clancy promoted when he took over as acting director in October.
