Workday -8% on in-line guidance, slower unearned revenue growth
May 26 2015, 17:33 ET | About: Workday (WDAY) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor
With the company having provided above-consensus guidance more often than not since its IPO, Workday (NYSE: WDAY ) has sold off after providing an in-line FQ2 outlook (affected by forex headwinds) to go with an FQ1 beat.
Also: The cloud HR/financials software leader's unearned revenue balance rose 41% Y/Y in FQ1 to $653.4M, a slower clip than FQ3's 53% and trailing revenue growth of 57%. Subscription revenue rose 63% Y/Y to $201M, and professional services 38% to $50M.
Financials: GAAP costs/expenses rose 44% Y/Y to $304.4M - sales/marketing spend totaled $94.9M, R&D $99.3M, G&A $32.2M, and cost of services $77.8M. Workday ended FQ1 with $1.9B in cash/marketable securities, and $496M in convertible debt. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months is $50.4M.
Shares have fallen to $85.12 AH.

So what is it? Why is the cloud so nebulous? Conventional software companies made money, and still do. Has any cloud company, be it delivering hardware or software, ever made any serious money? The idea that the problem is growing pains is just laughable. Since when was growth an obstacle to profits?

Though still richly valued, CRM and WDAY are cash flow positive. CRM's FY15 FCF was $883M. I have no position in either company, but I think those who short CRM/WDAY or other cloud software stocks while valuing them based on EPS instead of FCF are playing with fire.

CRM is 15 years old. How long does it take the "deferred revenue" to make them profitable? All SaaS cloud business platform companies are not or barely profitable. Many are mature companies and not startups. That tells you something is seriously wrong with this business model and it is only being held up by investors throwing easy money at them. Once the investor money dries up for this sector, they will start dropping out one by one. If they are lucky they will get bought at a substantially lower price than the current market cap before going bankrupt.
