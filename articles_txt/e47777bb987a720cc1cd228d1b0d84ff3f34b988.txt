TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida lawmakers will consider legislation to extend the gambling compact the state has with the Seminole Tribe for one year.
Sen. Rob Bradley announced Friday that the Senate Regulated Industries Committee will consider a bill next week to let the tribe continue offering card games like blackjack for another year.
Without an extension, the tribe will have to shut down card games in July under the agreement signed in 2010. Other parts of the compact, including the right to operate slot machines, will continue.
The tribe owns six Florida casinos, including the highly profitable Hard Rock Casinos in Broward County and Tampa.
Bradley said with only four weeks left in session and several complicated issues unresolved, it would be better to wait until next year to negotiate a new deal.
