OREM, Utah (ABC 4 UTAH) - A Utah man who met President Obama is now garnishing national attention.  The engineer who works in the solar energy department at Vivint wore a white polo instead of a business suit.  Marvin Futch was selected to meet with the President after Vivint learned the White House wanted a representative from their solar energy division who was also in the military.
This is Marvin Futch. He's active Utah Air National Guard. He's the Vivint solar engineer seen in this photo with President Barack Obama, Orrin Hatch, LDS church leaders, and other officials Futch is the only one in a polo. He still has it.  He says the messages from the White House were vague and he thought he was meeting a White House official and was supposed to wear business casual.
"I was really nervous at first. I realized I was wearing a white polo in front of my Commander-in-Chief.  Once the nervous calmed down, I realized this was a wonderful opportunity to speak with the president about the veterans and the solar energy," said Vivint's Marvin Futch.
Futch remained and spoke about the needs of veterans; training and education to enter the workforce.  Despite being under-dressed, Futch says he's happy he attended.
