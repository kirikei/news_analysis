Burundi president seeks poll funds
NAIROBI — Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza has asked "patriotic citizens" to donate money to help the East African country hold elections scheduled for next month after international partners withdrew support.
While the government had "gathered much of the necessary means" to hold parliamentary polls on Friday next week and a presidential vote on June 26, "to fulfil its commitment to establish a democratic culture based on the universal principle of choice by the people", citizens were invited to make a "voluntary contribution", the presidency said yesterday on its official Facebook page.
"Anyone who wants to contribute can. We are doing it because the partners of Burundi are not going to send any money to hold elections," presidential spokesman Willy Nyamitwe said.
At least 20 people have died and 420 have been injured in unrest in Burundi since Mr Nkurunziza signalled he would run for a third term in the elections, a move his opponents say violates peace accords.
The United Nations says at least 112,000 others have fled to neighbouring countries, fearing a return to conflict in a nation where 300,000 people died in a civil war that ended in 2005.
Burundi’s former colonial ruler, Belgium, on May 11 said that it had suspended a second tranche of €2m of aid for the electoral process, AFP reported, citing the international development ministry.
Switzerland and the Netherlands later did the same, according to AFP.
The presidency’s Facebook post listed a bank account into which it said donations for the elections could be paid.
"Elections belong to the people of Burundi, so to contribute is a good thing," Mr Nyamitwe said.
Burundi’s government has condemned mounting diplomatic pressure over Mr Nkurunziza’s bid to stand for a third term, signalling it would not bow to international criticism.
The government had "red lines", spokesman Philippe Nzobonariba said on state radio, indicating that Mr Nkurunziza was unwilling to compromise despite the political crisis having already sparked civil unrest, an attempted coup, a refugee crisis and international isolation.
In a fresh blow Tuesday, major donor France announced that it was suspending aid to the Burundi police and defence establishment, both of which have been engaged in a violent crackdown on protesters.
"The government of Burundi is deeply concerned by the current diplomatic activity, which could undermine and denigrate our republican institutions and constitution," Mr Nzobonariba told state radio.
Parliamentary polls were initially scheduled to take place on Tuesday, but have been postponed to Friday next week.
