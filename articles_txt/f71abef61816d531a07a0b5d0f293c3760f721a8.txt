HOUSTON (AP) - A Houston-area man has been arrested and accused of conspiring to support the Islamic State.
A U.S. Attorney’s Office statement says Asher Abid Khan was arrested Tuesday morning. A criminal complaint says the 20-year-old Spring resident and an unidentified friend plotted to travel to Turkey and on to Syria with the intent of joining and fighting with Islamic State.
The documents allege Khan’s friend made it to Syria and Islamic State with Khan’s help. Khan, who had been living in Australia, made it to Istanbul, where he was to rendezvous with his friend to join Islamic State. However, Khan’s family deceived him into returning home to Texas.
If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in federal prison. Federal records list no attorney for him.
