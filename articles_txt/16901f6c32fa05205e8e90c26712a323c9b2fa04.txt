Irving, who is averaging 18.9 points in the playoffs, was considered a game-time decision and it became known shortly before Tuesday's tipoff that he would play.
The team announced he would play no more than 25 minutes in Game 4. Matthew Dellavedova took Irving's place in the starting lineup in Game 3.
The Cavaliers won both games Irving missed and hold a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
