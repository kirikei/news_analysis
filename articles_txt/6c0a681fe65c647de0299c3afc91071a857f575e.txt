RIVERSIDE: Lee's Sandwiches recalls 100 tons of meat
 
 
Lee's is known for its inexpensive “Vietnamese-style” sandwiches. A signature baguette sandwich contains ingredients such as cold slices of head cheese, jambon (salted ham), pate, julienne carrots, onions, mayonnaise and cilantro.
Leeâs Sandwiches has recalled 213,000 pounds of meat products because the food was made without being inspected and because it bore unauthorized United States Department of Agriculture marks of inspection, according to the USDAâs Food Safety and Inspection Service.
The chicken, beef and pork products were recalled by the Garden Grove-based company from its restaurants in six states, including California, the USDA said in a press release.
âFSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to the consumption of these products,â according to the release. âAnyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.â
âDuring this review, FSIS personnel observed and detained non-federally inspected products which were produced at the warehouse distributorship and had applied USDA marks of inspection without authorization,â the USDA release said.
The biggest quantities of recalled meat products were âpork pate chaudâ (61,000 pounds), âchicken pate chaudâ (56,000 pounds), âbanh bao pork and egg steamed bunâ (55,000 pounds), âsliced oil browned turkeyâ (23,000 pounds) and âbanh boa trung cut pork and quail egg steamed bunâ (15,000 pounds).
Consumers with questions can contact Leeâs Sandwichâs Chief Operating Officer Tom Quach at 714-333-8688.
