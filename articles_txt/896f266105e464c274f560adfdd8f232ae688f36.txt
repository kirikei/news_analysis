The Daily Briefing
Your Right to Know
WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle earned $477,383 in 2014, less than in previous years as sales of his books declined, according to their tax return released by the White House on Friday.
Obama is paid $400,000 as president. For 2014, the couple paid $93,362 in income taxes.
The couple’s federal tax return showed that they gave $70,712 to 33 charities; the largest gift, $22,012, went to Fisher House Foundation, which houses military families while a relative is hospitalized.
Most of the Obamas’ income above the president’s government salary came from publishers Dystel & Goderich and Random House, and from interest, according to the return.
The Obamas earned $503,183 in 2013 and $662,076 in 2012.
The president’s highest income during his tenure was in 2009, the year he took office, when he reported $5.5 million, including book sales and the Nobel Peace Prize’s $1.4 million cash award.
Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, a community-college professor, also released their tax returns Friday, reporting a combined income of $388,844.
