CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving  started Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals after missing two games with a sore left knee.
Irving sat out Cleveland's wins in Games 2 and 3 with tendinitis. He tested the knee during the morning shootaround and again before tip-off. The Cavs announced he would play about 30 minutes before the start.
The Cavs said Irving, who is now wearing a brace, will be monitored during the game. The Cavs have a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
In the opener, Irving scored 10 points and had six assists in 27 minutes. He only played 12 minutes in the Cavs' series-clinching win in Chicago on May 14. He tweaked his knee in that game and Matthew Dellavedova started the next games at point guard.
Irving has also been slowed by a sprained right foot sustained in the opening round against Boston.

Cavs' Kyrie Irving to play in Game 4 against Hawks

CLEVELAND, OH (WOIO) - Cleveland Cavaliers have announced guard Kyrie Irving will play and start in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night.
Irving missed the previous two games after an MRI test earlier in the month showed he has tendinitis in his left knee. Irving will be on a time-limit, however. 
The Cavaliers went 2-0 without him in the lineup. Backup point guard Matthew Dellavedova stepped up in Irving's absence, averaging 14 points a game. 
Irving aggravated his knee in Game 6 against the Chicago Bulls when he landed awkwardly on Tristan Thompson. He never returned to the series-clinching game. 
The first game of the 2015 NBA Finals takes place on June 4. 
If the Hawks can pull off a Game 4 victory, the series will continue with Game 5 in Atlanta.
