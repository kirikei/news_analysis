The top House and Senate budget negotiators are returning to Washington D.C. early from congressional recess to begin to hash out a final fiscal blueprint agreement, several sources told POLITICO.

Both blueprints balance the budget in a decade by cutting about $5 trillion, without raising taxes, and add nearly $96 to the Pentagon’s budget through a war-funding account not subject to current spending caps.
But they still have to iron out some differences, including the size and scope of future domestic spending, how specific to go in wringing savings out of Medicare and how to use a powerful procedural tool that allows the Senate to pass legislation on a simple majority vote instead of the typical 60-vote threshold.
Agreeing on how to use that procedure, known as reconciliation, is a top priority for Republicans who want to show they can govern now that they lead both chambers. Reconciliation gives the GOP an opportunity to, for the first time ever, send President Barack Obama an Obamacare repeal — but only if both chambers pass a budget agreement.
The chairmen have said they want a final budget agreement, and votes to approve it, by April 15. But lawmakers only return to town on Monday, April 13, leaving them only a couple days to nominate conferees, hold a public hearing on the agreement and then push it through both chambers.
That deadline, however, is not hard and fast. If they miss it, they can still pass a budget at a later point with few consequences.
