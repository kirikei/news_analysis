According to KSDK , half of the city council’s seats were up for grabs:
“Ella Jones, a black woman, was elected in Ward 1 with 50 percent of the vote. She replaces a police officer who stepped down from the council. She defeated Mike McGrath, Adrienne Hawkins and Doyle McClellan.
Ward 3 covers the neighborhood where Michael Brown died. Two black men were running, and Wesley Bell defeated Lee Smith with 67 percent of the vote. Bell is a young criminal justice professor and municipal court judge.”
Before Tuesday, the city council consisted of five Caucasian members, including Mayor James Knowles. Mayor Knowles and the sitting African American councilman, Dwayne James, were not up for election this year.
Perhaps even more notable was the exceptionally high voter turnout for the local election, with almost double the number of voters participating. KSDK reported :
“Eric Fey, director of the St. Louis County Board of Elections, says 29 percent of the registered voters in Ferguson turned out to vote. That is significantly higher than past municipal elections. Turnout in 2014 was about 12 percent and 2013 was about 11 percent.”
The firestorm of debate after the death of Michael Brown and the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson led many to wonder why a city with a 67% African American population had such disproportionately white representation.
According to The Washington Post , “just two black candidates had ever sought office in the city,” but Brown’s death brought new awareness to the city.
Voters in Ferguson believe the real change will come after their elections. Charrolynn Washington told the Associated Press :
“As much change is needed here in Ferguson, this is where we begin – not out there in the streets, doing what they were doing – but, right here.”
The new city council will be tasked with finding replacements for Ferguson’s city manager, police chief, and municipal judge, all who resigned following the investigation into the city by the Department of Justice.
