AP WAS THERE: 150 years ago, Lee surrenders to Grant
EDITOR'S NOTE: When Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in a farmhouse parlor in Appomattox Court Property, Virginia, on April 9, 1865, standing with other war correspondents in the front yard was William Downs MacGregor...
The names of numerous AP Civil War correspondents, along with their original manuscript reports, have been lost. But those like MacGregor, whose names have been occasionally printed beneath their dispatches, are remembered for delivering disciplined and restrained accounts in an era when reporting was typically laced with shrill and sectarian opinion.
The Linked Press had been organized as a newspaper cooperative in 1846, just two years immediately after the initially prosperous telegraph message had been sent. For the duration of the war, the AP and most huge city papers utilized the thousands of miles of ever-expanding telegraph lines to revolutionize war reporting. For the 1st time, battlefield victories and defeats could be transmitted and even printed within a day.
Competition was typically fierce: When Washington officially confirmed Lee's surrender, 1 northern paper boasted it beat AP's telegraphic report by 15 minutes. News of the Union victory spread inside hours to most big cities in the North and was published there the following day. (Southern papers, for the most aspect, had by this time been taken more than by Union loyalists, had their presses destroyed, or could no longer publish for want of ink and paper.)
But telegraph lines were wildly unreliable as well, subject to storms and continual cutting by the combatants. Longer and far more fully detailed accounts of the moment most associated with the end of the war did not seem until April 14, the day Abraham Lincoln was shot and Union troops re-entered Fort Sumter, South Carolina, the spot where the war began.
