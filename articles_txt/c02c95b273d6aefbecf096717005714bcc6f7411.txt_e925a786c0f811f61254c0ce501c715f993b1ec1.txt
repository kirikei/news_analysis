Peter Nettleton calls for safe return of his jihadist daughter and five grandchildren
ELEANOR HALL: Their images on social media shocked the world.
Now the Australian children photographed posing with their jihadist father with a collection of automatic weapons and a severed head are reported to be attempting to return home.
There are unconfirmed reports that Tara Nettleton, the wife of convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, is trying to persuade Australian authorities to allow her and her children back into the country.
The Prime Minister though is taking a hard line on anyone in their situation, and a report from the United Nations has revealed a massive terror financing operation linked to Khaled Sharrouf and members of his family.
Nick Grimm has our report.
NICK GRIMM: Sydney woman Tara Nettleton converted to Islam when she married her childhood sweetheart, beginning a life with the man who would father their five children and who himself would become arguably one of the most notorious and recognisable terrorists in the world.
PETER NETTLETON: I haven't seen my daughter for over 10 years.
NICK GRIMM: Today Tara Nettleton's father Peter gave what comment he could on media reports that his daughter and five grandchildren are seeking to return home again after following Khaled Sharrouf to Syria.
PETER NETTLETON: I've only seen two of the grandkids.
I don't know their whereabouts or what they're doing, I only know through the newspapers and television where they are and what they aren't doing so I don't know any more than you guys.
I still love my daughter and I hope she comes home safely.
NICK GRIMM: And asked if his daughter deserved to be allowed to come home, Peter Nettleton had just this to say as he retreated from the media pack.
PETER NETTLETON: I can't comment on that. That's all I've got to say.
NICK GRIMM: Australian authorities like the federal police and ASIO (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation) have also declined to comment specifically on individual cases of foreign fighters seeking to return to Australia, but both sides of politics are clear that those that do should face the full force of the law and the Abbott Government plans to strip citizenship rights from dual-nationals to ensure they can't return at all.
TONY ABBOTT: Well, the point I make is that crime is crime is crime.
NICK GRIMM: What's less clear is what should happen to those who can't be held responsible for their actions.
Today the Sharrouf family is a case in point.
While Prime Minister Tony Abbott is adamant that foreign fighters should expect to pay for their crimes on their return, what awaits their dependents is another matter.
TONY ABBOTT: If a minor commits a crime, again, there are standard provisions for dealing with that but the point I want to stress is that criminals will be punished whether they're young, whether they're old, whether they're male, whether they're female, whether they're criminals abroad or criminals at home, criminals will be punished.
And to participate in the kind of barbarism that we have seen so often in the Middle East is just wrong.
It's morally wrong and it's a crime under Australian law and it will be punished.
NICK GRIMM: Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said on AM this morning the case highlights the need for ministerial discretion in considering whether to revoke the citizenship of foreign fighters and those who have supported them.
PETER DUTTON: People face very serious consequences when they return to this country if they've broken Australian law.
And if they're in proscribed areas and they don't have a reason for being there, if they've been involved in supporting terrorists or involved in activities directly themselves, they will face the full force of the law when they return to Australia.
MICHAEL BRISSENDEN: Okay, and the children?
PETER DUTTON: Well the children, as I say, it depends on the circumstance, the ages of the children.
If they're infants, for example, then they would be in state care, as we've seen with some people who have decided to abandon their children and go off and fight in the name of ISIL.
So those arrangements would operate as they would with any family where parents have abandoned their children or not acting in the best interests of their children.
BILL SHORTEN: Well, I'm very concerned about the children...
NICK GRIMM: Opposition Leader Bill Shorten had this to offer when asked about the issue earlier today.
BILL SHORTEN: These children are in warzones seeing terrible things.
I frankly think it is child abuse to put children into that situation.
Obviously we need to be briefed, we've seen some of the headlines in the newspapers, but making those children safe is important.
NICK GRIMM: The issue was vexing the minds of political leaders on the same day that a United Nations report was released revealing the full extent of Khaled Sharrouf's support for Islamic state.
The report was prepared by a team monitoring compliance with the UN Security Council's sanctions regime.
It's found a money transfer business owned by Khaled Sharrouf's sister and brother-in-law had sent up to $20 million overseas to finance terrorism.
Previous reports about the money transfer business, which has now been shut down, had indicated the sums being sent overseas had been much lower.
ELEANOR HALL: Nick Grimm with that report.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The wife and five children of an Australian believed to have been photographed while holding severed heads of Syrian soldiers will face the "full severity of Australian law" if they attempt to return home, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Wednesday.
Abbott last week ruled out an amnesty for Australian citizens seeking to quit foreign militant groups and return home in the wake of media reports that his government was negotiating with potential defectors.
The family of suspected Australian Islamic State fighter Khaled Sharrouf would face the same consequences, Abbott said in response to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that Sharrouf's wife was seeking repatriation with their children.
"If criminals come within the reach of our law, whether they’re male or female, they will face the full severity of our law," Abbott told reporters.
" ... There are criminals who go to jail all the time and they have children, and the children of these particular criminals will be dealt with in the same way that the children of criminals are normally dealt with," he said.
Australia issued arrest warrants last year for Sharrouf and another Australian citizen believed to be fighting with Islamic State in Syria after images emerged of the two holding the severed heads of Syrian soldiers.
A money transfer business linked to Sharrouf's family was shut by the Australian government last year on suspicions it transferred up to A$20 million ($15.5 million) to foreign militants.
Analysts and Western government officials say Islamic State  finances its operations through the sale of oil from oil-producing territory it has seized, the sale of cultural heritage artifacts and works of art, extortion and ransoms, as well as private donations.
Abbott has unveiled a raft of tough new policies aimed at combating the threat from Islamist radicalism, appointing a new counter-terror coordinator and proposing laws to strip dual nationals of their citizenship if they engage in militant acts.
Australia is on high alert for attacks by radicalized Muslims or by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, having raised its threat level to high and undertaken a series of high-profile raids in major cities.
Under tough security powers declared by Abbott's conservative government in October, Australian citizens can face up to a decade in prison for travel to overseas areas declared off-limits.
