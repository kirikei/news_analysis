A courtroom sketch shows Saddiq al-Abbadi (R) as he pleads guilty during a hearing in Brooklyn federal court in New York on Tuesday.
An Al Qaeda terrorist pleaded guilty Tuesday to fighting against U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Saddiq Al-Abbadi, 40, also admitted in Brooklyn Federal Court to providing material support to a terrorist organization by using his connections to help Long Island wannabe jihadist Bryant Neil Vinas join Al Qaeda.
Al-Abbadi, a Yemeni national, told Judge Nicholas Garaufis that he wielded an AK-47 "machine gun" on the battlefield with intention to "hurt, wound and kill" American troops.
Prosecutors alleged that in May 2008, Al-Abbadi was the leader of mujahideen fighters in a gun battle that killed one U.S. Army Ranger in Afghanistan.
"Al-Abbadi has been a member of Al Qaeda for at least a decade…(and) he engaged directly with senior Al Qaeda leadership, including Sheikh Saeed al-Masri, the then third ranking member of Al Qaeda" in Pakistan, court papers state.
Al-Abbadi and his co-defendant Ali Alvi, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges, were captured in Saudi Arabia and turned over to U.S. authorities.
They were ratted out by Vinas, who received Al Qaeda military training and suggested a plot to attack the Long Island Railroad before he was captured and became a cooperating witness for the government.
Al-Abbadi faces 30 years to life in prison when he is sentenced in September.
