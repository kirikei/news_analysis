WASHINGTON (AP) — The first man to ever serve as White House social secretary is now planning his own exit.
The White House announced Wednesday that Jeremy Bernard is leaving after four years in the high-profile post.
As social secretary, Bernard oversaw everything from this week's annual Easter Egg Roll to opulent state dinners, along with numerous receptions, ceremonies and other events.
He plans to leave after a state dinner for Japan at the end of the month. There was no word on what Bernard will do next.
Bernard was named to the post in February 2011. He was the third social secretary to serve President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama .
A replacement is expected to be announced soon.
