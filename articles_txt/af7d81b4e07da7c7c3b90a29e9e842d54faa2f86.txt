GOP presidential hopeful scores huge haul in less than a week

Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential effort is getting into the shock-and-awe fundraising business.
 
Although super PACs have radically changed the pace at which committees backing presidential candidates can raise money, the Cruz haul is remarkable. There are no known cases in which an operation backing a White House hopeful has collected this much money in less than a week.
 
Cruz’s campaign is also expected to raise money competitively at the grassroots level through the Internet and small-dollar contributions, as well as through traditional bundling of so-called hard dollar checks, which are subject to limits of $2,700 per election per individual.
According to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission, the treasurer for the cluster of new super PACs is Dathan Voelter, an Austin attorney who is a longtime friend and financial backer of Cruz. All three PACs have a variant of the name “Keep the Promise.”
A document prepared by the super PAC organizers says they “are committed to raising the resources necessary to promote Senator Cruz in his efforts to win the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.”
