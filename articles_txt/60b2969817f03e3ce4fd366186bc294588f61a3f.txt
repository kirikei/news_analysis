Not all young women would necessarily be pleased to hear that they look just like their mothers, but when your mom is Hollywood stunner Demi Moore, you just go with it.
Newly crowned Dancing with the Stars winner Rumer Willis shared a photo on her Instagram account of her and her mom posing in matching jumpsuits. While Moore, 52, is twice the age of her 26-year-old daughter with ex-husband Bruce Willis, the two women look nearly identical.
"That moment when you realize you actually are becoming your mother #twinning #imnotmad," Willis wrote as the caption.
Last week, Willis and her partner Val Chmerkovskiy beat out Riker Lynch and Noah Galloway to be named the victors on Season 20 of Dancing with the Stars.
