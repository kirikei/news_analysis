Paul will attend the fundraiser at the home of Ron Sechrist, the founder of Anaheim-based Sechrist Industries, the manufacturer of hyperbaric oxygen chambers and respiratory equipment, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Supporters are being asked to contribute up to $10,400 to a joint fundraising committee composed of Paul’s Senate re-election committee and his political action committee, according to an invitation obtained by the Times.
Paul is also seeking re-election to his Senate seat in 2016.
The 52-year-old Paul declared his presidential candidacy Tuesday with a speech in Louisville, Kentucky, explaining that his “vision for America” includes “a return to government restrained by the Constitution” and “a return to privacy, opportunity and liberty.”
Paul, a son of former Rep. Ron Paul, a three-time presidential candidate, is in the midst of a five-day, six-state tour, mainly of the early caucus and primary states of New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada.
