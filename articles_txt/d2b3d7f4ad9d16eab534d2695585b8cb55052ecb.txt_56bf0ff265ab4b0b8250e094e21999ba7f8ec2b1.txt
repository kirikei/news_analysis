By Anya George Tharakan
May 26 (Reuters) - Digital video recorder maker TiVo Inc  reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, helped by higher subscriptions.
Shares of the company, which also said it bought Poland-based Cubiware, rose 6.2 percent in extended trading on Tuesday.
TiVo's set-top boxes are in high demand from cable users as they also allow access to online video services such as Netflix Inc, Hulu and Google Inc's YouTube.
The company's total subscriptions rose about 27 percent to 5.8 million in the first quarter ended April 30.
TiVo, whose clients include DirecTV, is trying to partner with more cable TV operators to grow its business.
TiVo sells subscriptions directly to consumers with its video recorders and also licenses its technology to cable TV operators that rent recorders to subscribers.
The company sells its products through cable TV partners such as Virgin Media in the UK, ONO in Spain and Com Hem AB  in Sweden.
TiVo said the acquisition of Poland-based Cubiware would allow it to expand into 25 countries.
Cubiware, which provides software for pay-TV operators, has customers across Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
"We will continue to look at acquisitions that we think make strategic sense," TiVo Chief Executive Tom Rogers said in an interview, adding that the company is looking at "a lot of things."
TiVo expects the deal to add to adjusted EBITDA in the year ending Jan. 31.
TiVo's net income fell to $7.9 million in the first quarter, from $8.1 million a year earlier, hurt by higher costs. On a per-share basis, however, profit rose by a cent to 8 cents on lower share count.
Total revenue costs rose about 16 percent to $44.1 million.
Net revenue rose about 7.2 percent to $114.7 million.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 7 cents per share and revenue of $91.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The San Jose, California-based company's shares, which closed at $10.36 on the Nasdaq, were at $10.84 after the bell.   (Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)

Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to TiVo's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I will now hand the program over to Derrick Nueman. Please go ahead.
Derrick Nueman
Thank you, and good afternoon. I'm Derrick Nueman, TiVo's Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to TiVo's first quarter of fiscal year ending January 31st, 2015 earnings call. With today are Tom Rogers, CEO; Naveen Chopra, CFO; and Matt Zinn, our General Counsel.
We just distributed a press release and 8-K detailing our first quarter financial results. We also posted a first quarter key metric trend sheet on our Investor Relations' website that includes among other information a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures discussed in today's call.
You may access a recording of this call on our website over the next week. Our prepared remarks will last about 30 minutes, followed by a question-and-answer session. Our discussion today includes forward-looking statements about TiVo's future business, products and growth strategies.
We caution you not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as they involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially from our forward-looking statements as described in our risk factors and our reports filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements made on the call today reflect our analysis as of today and we have no plans or duty to update them.
With that I will now turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Rogers
Thanks, Derrick. Good afternoon everyone. As you all know, TiVo has moved way beyond being just a DVR company. It is now clear that the consumer will have the ability to put together their own television package with a degree of flexibility that seemed unimaginable, even a year ago.
While the role of the cable operator is still vitally important in all this, the consumer has more of a say than ever, with regard to cord-cutting, unbundling content, streaming services, and delivery from the cloud. TiVo is a player in all those arenas and we're driving innovation behind all of it to give the consumer what they want and how they want it.
Yet at the same time, we are dedicated to making the pay TV experience, the best video experience a viewer can have and we will make sure that is true going well into the future.
TiVo has now almost six million subscriptions globally; triple our base from the first quarter of 2012. The significant subscription increases we have achieved are a testament to our ability to simplify the consumption of video content, the unique proposition in a world where distribution of content for the consumer is becoming increasingly chaotic from many different types of sources.
TiVo takes live, recorded, broadcast, cable, video-on-demand, subscription video-on-demand, TV Everywhere, streaming services and web video and puts it all together into a single approach that makes it very easy for the subscriber to access what they want, when they want it, on a personalized multi-device basis.
Today, our innovative platform serves a diverse set of clients. Cable operators that want to offer their consumers the best set-top box option, retail customers of cable operators who want a better experience than what their cable company gives them, as well as viewers looking for a cheaper television experience where they can put together their own package of over-the-top content, DVR and streaming services.
Now, let's get into the details of the quarter. It was a solid start to fiscal 2016 for TiVo. Our business is performing well and we're executing on our long-term business strategy. We expect that we will deliver even stronger financial metrics and shareholder returns as we sign on more operator deals, bring on more TiVo subscriptions, both retail and operator, develop additional cutting edge products, reduce our operating expense framework, and allocate capital to continued innovation as well as our ongoing share repurchase program.
During the quarter, we posted record service and technology revenues, driven primarily by a 27% year-over-year increase in total subscriptions. We delivered operating expense reductions of $1 million year-over-year, including a decrease in R&D where we've gotten more efficient through initiatives like our [indiscernible].
We posted adjusted EBITDA of $29 million at the high end of our guidance. We announced the acquisition of Cubiware -- just announced that, I should say, to service a larger portion of the global pay TV market which is expected to grow to 1 billion subs by 2020.
We strengthened our current operator relationships with extension of the Virgin Media partnership and through bundling efforts at ONO. We posted positive net adds in the TiVo-Owned business, and we have now purchased $56 million worth of stock since we instituted our $550 million share repurchase program last year, including $20 million this past quarter.
Our operator efforts continue to produce strong results. We have 4.8 million operator subscriptions, having added more than 1.2 million since the first quarter of last year, and 285,000 this past quarter. The 34% year-over-year increase in subscriptions translated into 41% year-over-year MSO service revenue growth, which is an acceleration over last quarter's growth rate.
As we have noted before, we expect that this momentum will continue as existing relationships scale and as we form new distribution relationships. We also continue to deepen and strengthen our current operator relationships.
In April, we extended our deal with Virgin Media and as part of the new agreement; Virgin Media has committed to the development of next-generation solutions from TiVo. In Spain, the ONO television offering powered by TiVo is now being marketed by Vodafone as a bundled package to mobile customers, highlighting the valuable role that we play in helping Vodafone with its quad-play strategy and ultimately, in growing its business.
We're seeing increasing momentum in contribution from our North American operator partners, which represented 48% of our total new MSO subscription additions in the first quarter, the highest it has ever been.
Cogeco launched the TiVo product in its Quebec market and the early results there are promising. This launch was important, as it was the first time the TiVo software has included bilingual capabilities, which is something we believe can help as we look to expand distribution in Canada as well as other regions where this is a necessary capability.
We see a lot of upside in the North American market. We currently have a variety of customers who use our end-to-end solutions and they're looking to very quickly deploy a full advanced TV solution with OTT integration, mobile capability, and much more.
We size that market at about 15 million homes between the U.S. and Canada. We've got about seven million of those homes represented by our existing operator contracts today, and our deployments within that base are accelerating.
We are also having active ongoing discussions with a number of operators covering the remaining eight million homes as well as with operators beyond this identified segment. We estimate that we're slightly less than 10% penetrated today among those North American homes under contract and we are seeing a lot of opportunity to grow.
Turning back to our international efforts for a moment, we made a very important announcement today regarding the acquisition of Cubiware, a provider of highly cost effective middleware solutions for international cable, satellite and IPTV operators.
This acquisition significantly expands our international presence with almost 40 operators across 25 countries, arms us with a more cost effective product offering and helps us to expand into emerging markets.
This will enable us to address a larger portion of the global TV market which, as I said, is expected to grow to over 1 billion subscribers by 2020. We anticipate that Cubiware will expand the growth of our operator business to new segments and will be accretive to current fiscal year adjusted EBITDA.
Further enhancing our operator business, we recently announced that TiVo software experience and cloud-based products will be integrated into ARRIS set-top box hardware. This deal means that TiVo now works with the largest global set-top box providers including ARRIS, Cisco, Pace, and Samsung.
Turning to Digitalsmiths, sales of our video discovery platform, products and services revenue grew 15% sequentially and roughly doubled year-over-year.
In the first quarter, we made significant progress with existing partners as we rolled out the new Foxtel set-top box platform and we saw a significant acceleration of our deployment with Time Warner Cable.
We expect this growth to continue as we drive further penetration within existing distribution partners, sign additional distribution deals in the future, and bring new products to market.
On the TiVo-Owned front, we continue to see an improving trajectory. For the first time in eight years, we saw positive net additions in the first quarter and we also saw a 22% year-over-year increase in gross additions.
These results were driven by the value consumers are placing on the TiVo multiscreen advanced television proposition, our continued product innovation, as well as the impact of the TiVo OTA product.
Now a quick word on our OTA product. We have the ability to meet the needs of an increasing number of consumers who want to put together their own bundle of an over-the-air DVR, and streaming services like Hulu and Netflix, enabling operators to thereby sustain a video relationship with so-called cord cutters. To the extent that the market moves more aggressively in that direction, our OTA product is well-positioned and will be an important contributor to our growth over time.
In our TiVo research business, we are beginning to take advantage of this rapid growth of programmatic television ad spending that's going on by integrating our unique data feeds into programmatic marketplaces.
Many industry experts have programmatic growing significantly from current levels and we believe that we are well-situated to take advantage of that growth, given the uniqueness of our research data.
We're seeing some early traction. We've grown our revenue meaningfully in the programmatic area through our relationships with industry players like Datalogix and clypd with a significant amount of others in the pipeline.
As we look forward, we believe that our programmatic efforts could drive meaningful growth in our research business, especially given the discussions we're having with a number of programmatic data buyers and sellers and as we look to further integrate our data into the programmatic ad sales ecosystem, by getting a slice of the revenue as opposed to solely trying to sell a research product, which has lower growth potential.
In conclusion, we are very pleased with our first quarter growth and the trends we are seeing. Our growth formula for this year and beyond is simple; more subs, more deals, more innovation, less operating expense, and fewer shares.
Execution on this formula will position us to drive strong long-term operating and financial results and most importantly, strong returns for our shareholders. We're excited about where we stand.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Naveen.
Naveen Chopra
Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. Before providing additional color on the quarter, I'd like to share some additional information regarding the Cubiware transaction we announced today.
As Tom just explained, the Cubiware purchase will enhance our ability to drive international by adding an even more us effective advanced TV option to our portfolio which ultimately helps us reach a wider portion of the global pay TV market.
Cubiware deal is structured with three components, enough front amount of $16 million, a fixed amount of $11.5 million that it’s paid over time subject to continued employment of certain key employees and an earn-out of up to $20.5 million specified annual revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth targets are achieved.
In the short run, we expect Cubiware to be accretive to full year adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2016. Longer term we believe that the effective adjusted EBITDA multiple paid on the deal will look very reasonable regardless of whether or not the earn-out is paid.
And lastly one housekeeping item related to Cubiware. When we start including Cubiware in our financials which will happen in Q2, we plan to exclude the amortization of the amount that is contingent on continued employment of certain employees as well as any expenses related to changes in the expected earn-out from our adjusted EBITDA calculation. Because we consider these charges to be non-recurring expenses related to the former shareholders of the business we acquire.
Now onto the details of our first quarter and our expectations for Q2 and beyond, Q1 was a strong start to fiscal year 2016. We exceeded our service and technology guidance and came in at the top end of adjusted EBITDA and net income guidance range.
Service and technology revenue was $92.4 million, up 7% year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by a 41% year-over-year increase in our MSO service revenue, which was an acceleration from last quarter's year-over-year growth rate of 30%. Our Digitalsmiths service and product revenue roughly doubled compared to the first quarter of last year.
As expected service gross margins increased to 61% in the first quarter compared to 58% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to a seasonally decrease in customer support cost and the growth at MSO and Digitalsmiths service revenue which has higher than average gross margins.
Our hardware gross margins were slightly negative for the quarter and included a $1.2 million retail inventory reserve. Excluding this non-forecasted impact, hardware margins would have been positive.
Additionally, operating expenses continued to move lower in the first quarter with R&D down 5% year-over-year. This led to adjusted EBITDA for Q1 of $29 million and net income of $7.9 million.
Net income was roughly flat relative to the year ago quarter, because it included $1.8 million of additional tax adjusted interest expense from the new convert we issued last year. This expense was not in the year ago number. Absent the additional interest expense net income would have been up almost 20% year-over-year.
Shifting to our subscription metric, we grew our total subscription base to almost 508 million including 285,000 net additions in our MSO business in the first quarter. We continue to see strong growth in domestic MSO subscription where net additions from North American cable operators were the highest we see to-date and represented about 48% of total Q1 MSO additions.
International subscription growth was down sequentially, as we saw lower Virgin Media additions versus the prior quarter, which we believe was a function of one of Virgin's competitors offering a temporary bundle promotion that included free broadband service.
In addition to our efforts on the operator side, we continue to see improving dynamic in our TiVo-Owned business. We had positive net additions in the quarter for the first time in eight years. Additionally, first quarter gross additions were 22% compared with a year ago quarter. We believe this volume increase was driven by the combination of more attractive whole-home pricing, our new TiVo OTA offering and continued product and feature enhancements.
Toward the last year TiVo-Owned ARPU fell sequentially from the fourth quarter mainly due to fewer days in the quarter, but also due to the verity of different subscription and pricing plans we now offer. While this is impacting ARPU, we believe over time the expanded product portfolio drive incremental volume that will offset the reduction in TiVo-Owned ARPU.
On the capital allocation front, we have now repurchased $266 million of stock or 21.5 million of shares since we implemented our $550 million stock re program last summer, including 20 million of repurchases this quarter. We are significantly ahead of our initial target for repurchases as we have taken advantage of weakness in our stock price to accelerate our buybacks.
The remains $284 million on our authorization which would equate to roughly to 27 million shares at our current stock price. This would add to almost 40 million shares or close to 500 million we put towards repurchases over the last three or so years.
We ended the quarter with $686 million of cash on the balance sheet, a reduction of $56 million from the fourth quarter. More than half of the cash used in Q1 related to non-recurring items including cash of licensing payment, investments, the purchase of the Aereo asset and the $6 million Verizon quarterly payment that was received two days after the quarter ended, as well as our stock repurchase.
We expect to see meaningful positive operative cash flow in Q2 when we benefit from our annual DISH licensing payment, the $6 million Verizon payment I just mention, and some positive working capital of business. This will, of course, be offset by the $16 million spent on Cubiware as well as incremental share repurchases.
Now getting to our guidance, for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect service and technology revenues of $94 million to $97 million. The midpoint of which is up 10 year-over-year. This outlook assumes sequential growth in our MSO service revenue and non-IP technology revenue as well as sequentially flat TiVo-Owned revenues, a further sign of stabilization in that business.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $29 million to $32 million and net income to be in the range of $7 million to $10 million. Driving the expected sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA, it’s the service revenue growth we just detail as well as the slight improvement in operating expenses.
Relative to the year ago quarter, we expect approximately $1 million to $2 million less hardware margin in Q2 of fiscal 2016. Meaning that absent the impact of hardware margin Q2 adjusted EBITDA would show even more growth relative to the prior year.
Additionally, Cubiware is not included in our Q2 guidance, because the deal was signed so close to our earnings announcement. But as a reminder, we do expect Cubiware to be accretive to full year adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2016.
As we look to the remainder to this year and beyond, our growth formula centers around more deals, more subs, more products, less operating expense and fewer shares outstanding.
Some factors that I think investors should keep in mind for the remainder of the year include; MSO and Digitalsmiths product services are expected to drive meaningful double-digit service revenue growth rate this year. Additionally, MSO service revenue growth rates are on track to accelerate from fiscal year 2015 levels as highlighted by the 41% year-over-year growth rate in Q1 despite a larger revenue base.
The opportunity for increasing service gross margins driven from growth of higher margin service revenue and continued efforts to manage operating expenses as we begin to benefit from our recently opened offshore development center in Romania and consolidation of existing outsourcing effort, the combination of which should create further R&D efficiency.
To reiterate something which on last quarter, we believe that our initiatives and focus on execution can drive significant adjusted EBITDA growth in the next few years and positions us to become a business that generates positive adjusted EBITDA beyond the exploration of our current IP revenue.
In the near term, we are confident that the combination of earnings growth from our strategic operating initiatives and a materially shrinking share count from our remaining repurchase authorization will drive meaningful shareholder value in our current fiscal year 2016.
With that, let's now take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
[Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies.
Brian Fitzgerald
Hi, thanks. Tom, a quick question with your comments around Cogeco, are you seeing similar adoption trends there as with other partners of that size and when you mentioned penetration being slightly less than 10%, any specific things you would call out as gaiting factors there to penetration or drivers of accelerating penetration? Thanks.
Tom Rogers
Cogeco is doing very nicely in terms of ongoing deployment and as I mentioned the entry into the French speaking areas with the bilingual element of the service we think will accelerate things.
The guts of my comments on 10% were with respect to our overall North American footprint of U.S. and Canada and it really is worth focusing on the fact that with the seven million or so subscribers that are covered by contract in that region for us, we are only about 10% penetrated.
Those are our highest ARPU cable customers. They tend to average, as we've talked about in the past, roughly about $2 per sub per month. And so we think substantial upside there. We don't see gaiting factors relative to that 10% growing substantially.
In fact, we see the increase in the focus on streaming services and all kinds of other competitive factors being a real fire under enhanced distribution by cable operators in the relative near-term. So, all of that I would point to as positive for our overall future growth.
Naveen Chopra
I would just add one thing to that which is to keep in mind that the overall penetration rate that's a little south of 10% is kind of a fully blended penetration rate, taking into account the operators that have come on very recently as well as those that have been with us for a longer period of time.
And if you were to just look at the ones where we've been deploying for two or three years, you would see a substantially higher penetration rate. The crux of which means that to some extent and one of the catalysts for driving that penetration up is just the time that is required for these guys to integrate and deploy.
Brian Fitzgerald
Operator
Andrew DeGasperi
Thanks. One question for you, Tom. What you -- can you give us a commentary on the recent M&A activity, Suddenlink, Time Warner Cable, what does that imply for your current deals with Digitalsmiths and others? And also, supposedly Vodafone and Liberty Global, you made some comments there, can you just give us some color on that?
Tom Rogers
Sure. I'd say consolidation overall has been a positive for us. We've seen it with Liberty and Virgin as you said and since that has happened, the subs that we have seen roll out with Virgin have increased substantially. We've entered into a new deal with Virgin and the deal has improved economics for us overall. We've seen a step-up in our relationship with ONO since Vodafone has come in to acquire it.
Speaking of Cogeco again, they own ABB; one of our American domestic cable operators, but by virtue of the relationship we had with ABB, Cogeco is their Canadian parent, got interested in TiVo and expanded us into the Canadian market.
So, overall, I'd say that consolidation has been our friend. I think consolidation is going to continue. With respect to Charter and Time Warner, we are a Digitalsmiths provider, meaning we, through our Digitalsmiths service, power the advanced interface of both Time Warner and Charter through the Digitalsmiths metadata cloud-based service feeds.
And Digitalsmiths increased its revenue almost doubling year-over-year, much of that coming from an acceleration of Time Warner's roll-out of Digitalsmiths most recently since both Charter and the Time Warner side are players with us on Digitalsmiths, we would hope that the combined company would be very much an ongoing player with us with respect to the growth of that service.
So, overall, we see these trends as reasonably positive. But as you know we focus on a part of the market where we have been able to drive substantial distribution where consolidation to-date, at least, has not been a major factor and we look at the Cubiware situation as internationally being able to give us a vehicle to provide substantial distribution through a number of players who we think will continue to be independent in terms of their overall ownership status.
Andrew DeGasperi
Just one quick question on Cubiware. I know you said that adjusted EBITDA would be accretive, but can you give us some sense of the topline, how much revenues they generate?
Tom Rogers
It's not all that different from what Digitalsmiths was from a revenue point of view when we acquired Digitalsmiths. And obviously the multiple that we acquired Cubiware at was substantially lower one than was the case with Digitalsmiths. But as you know Digitalsmiths revenues have been growing quite rapidly as of late.
Andrew DeGasperi
Your next question comes from Tony Wible with Janney Capital.
Tony Wible
I was hoping you could recap where we were on the VMED and ONO penetration rates? And then also touch on what do you think gives you the higher lifetime value on a subscriber, a standalone subscriber with the over-the-air opportunity or an MSO sub at this point?
Tom Rogers
So, Tony, on the penetration rates for VMED and ONO, they are -- VMED is based on the numbers that have been disclosed around two-thirds of their base deployed with TiVo. That's of their current base.
Keep in mind that they recently announced Project Lightning which is a significant expansion of their footprint with a potential to add I think something on the order of another four million homes to the 10 million, 11 million that they pass today.
And on ONO, we're probably a little over 50% penetrated there, which I think is quite an accomplishment, given some of the market can conditions that have existed over the last few years. And then could you just repeat the question on --
Tony Wible
Yeah. It just seems like you kind of have this dichotomy in subs. You've always had the standalone. You have MSO subs and it seems like with the retail side of business picking up a little bit more momentum, just trying to get a sense of what has a greater lifetime value to you as a subscriber, a retail subscriber or an MSO subscriber, given obviously one has more cost front-end loaded on it, has a different churn characteristics? I'm just kind of curious your thoughts there.
Tom Rogers
Yeah, I mean if you were to purely look at the numbers, it's honestly not quite that simple to put it into those categories. There are MSO subs that are highly valuable to us based on the fees that we get and the lifetimes that we expect out of those and the fact that we don't incur a lot of cost. And in some cases those can start to rival the value of a retail subscriber.
But by the same token, there are a lot of different flavors of retail subscribers, between folks that take our lifetime product, folks that are on a multi-room subscription, OTA subscribers.
I think in broad strokes, obviously we typically are generating more value out of a retail subscriber than we are out of a MSO sub on a fully blended basis, but if you peel the onion back a little bit, there's a lot of different flavors.
Naveen Chopra
And Tony, remember that if in general the retail subs we're getting are coming from a separate pool than the operator subs. So, that's us pushing for both of them are pretty symbiotic.
Tony Wible
Operator
Your next question comes from David Miller with Topeka Capital Markets.
David Miller
Its great print, congratulations. Tom and Naveen, feel free to chime in. I think there's still kind of the impression on the street, albeit somewhat flawed, that you guys are facing a patent cliff issue in June of 2018.
I know you've addressed this before in various sort of public comments and conferences and maybe in the press and stuff like that for -- but for the benefit of some of the folks that are on this call, maybe shareholders that are kind of worried about this, could you address it yet again because as it applies to at least the Dish and the AT&T stuff, I think it's holding back progress of the stock. Thanks very much.
Tom Rogers
Sure. Well, we have a substantial number of patents that go well beyond 2018 timeframe. Now the average duration of our patents is about 13 years going forward. As importantly we are adding to our intellectual property on regular basis given the kind of innovation we are investing in and the very substantial role we play in the implementation of all kinds of technologies on the operator front and with that our patent portfolio continues to grow both domestically and internationally.
We haven’t given any estimates as to what we believe the value of that portfolio is or the revenue that we can drive from that portfolio 2019 and beyond, but a number of our patent license agreements really are limited to a very small portion of our overall patents meaning that many of them are not covered even under the existing deals -- many of our patents are not covered even under our existing deals.
We believe very strongly that the view that somehow we go from hugely valuable IP assets to a patent portfolio that is worth zero post 2019 is a overly harsh, very difficult view for we think any reasonable analyst of our future prospects to take. We certainly believe that there is substantial value there even if one cannot take from any of our guidance a specific quantification of it, but the notion that it falls off to zero we think is way to harsh a view of what the potential for the IP is particularly as it continues to grow and particularly as our leadership position in certain key aspects of the implementation of advanced television are more and more vital.
Naveen Chopra
I guess, David, the one thing I would add to that is, you know, in addition to the significant value of the IP beyond 2018, we have obviously got a number of businesses that are growing very nicely between -- the MSO business, the Digitalsmiths business, stabilization of the retailer business, improving trends on OpEx. And I think it’s really the combination of that and the long term value of IP that, you know, you can project out and see a scenario where we are generating much more growth than we are losing in terms of the cash that we are getting today from existing IP settlements.
David Miller
Operator
Our next question comes from Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets.
Barton Crockett
Thanks for taking the question. Now, I guess, two things if I could. First, just following up on the discussion about patent value. I do want to be clear. I mean, you guys are collecting patent fees right now for settlements. Those fees you are collecting right now do not apply to any patents the past 2018, is that correct, or is some value in there for those patents that extend past 2018?
Naveen Chopra
There a very nominal amount that relates to IP beyond 2018, but it would really not preclude our ability to license it more broadly.
Barton Crockett
Okay. All right. So I believe that there will be value to come, but it’s not yet realized.
Naveen Chopra
Barton Crockett
Now, in terms of the Cubiware acquisition, I want to be clear that technology that you're buying from them that's more in addition to your portfolio that's not something that your existing portfolio would leverage, like TiVo's not going to run on top of this middleware. Is that correct?
Naveen Chopra
That's correct.
Barton Crockett
Naveen Chopra
This is really about expanding the portfolio given us some additional solutions that will allow us to address some of the emerging markets where there is a real premium on, you know, getting the cost of deployment and cost of maintenance down and that's something that Cubiware has done very effectively.
Barton Crockett
Okay. Now that is a market that I am not familiar with. So I am wondering if you can talk about what advantage is Cubiware brings relative to its competition and who you would see as the major competitors in this middleware market for these areas of the world.
Naveen Chopra
Well, the things about the Cubiware product that have impressed us and I think certainly impressed their existing base of customers which is we mentioned is quite broad, covering a lot of different geographies, a lot of different technologies, they have got cable operators, IPTV operators, satellite operators. And they would all, I think, point to the fact that one, very cost effective solution; two, highly customizeable solution, so a good combination of flexibility being able to tailor the product to the needs of the operator, but also do in a way that's quite cost efficient.
A lot of hardware flexibility meaning ability to get on very low cost boxes which has, you know, we see the generation trend or more IP base delivery, a lot of thin clients that's I think a real priority.
And I think its generation responsiveness to a lot of these operators and that's where I think we have seen real designation between the folks that have been successful in the market and the others haven’t, is the ability to scale and address a number of different operators without just having to build bunch of the custom one-off solutions. And I think that something Cubiware had really now.
In terms of competitive environment, it’s fragmented frankly. They are operating in a number of different geographies. And you will see some in-house solutions there. You will see some local players. They do compete with some of the traditional middleware folks NDS, Cisco as an example in some accounts as well.
Tom Rogers
We very much appreciate about what they have been able to do, as they have been able to make inroads in Latin America and the Caribbean, a number European markets, a number of Asian markets including Indonesia. And so it is a company that has really been able to demonstrate competitiveness in multiple regions throughout the world and specializes in both cost efficiency, but a high quality product.
Barton Crockett
Okay. And then in terms of your growth outlook for them, is that -- are you changing anything that they are doing, or is it really you own them and you just expect them to grow without really you do much to them at this point.
Naveen Chopra
You know, we think there is some clearly strategic value in the combination in the sense that we have assets that we can bring on the table that can enhance and accelerate their road map. We are obviously further ahead in things like OTT integration, the ability to tie into a cloud based search and discovery system in the form of Digitalsmiths and be able to sell that as a fully integrated ready-to-go solution, I think is something that will also help accelerate their growth.
But we are going to be relying on them to do the lion share of the development and maintain the efficiency that is made them successful so far.
Tom Rogers
As you know Barton, one of the issues that any cable operator faces when it comes to making a strategic decision about who its middleware and UI provider are, is what the is the financial wherewithal of the company they are making that major strategic fit on.
And I think the fact that we show up as a much bigger stronger company gives a degree of confidence to any number of operators who would be in discussions are considering Cubiware, and I think in that sense we very much provide a way to advance their ability to penetrate the market.
Barton Crockett
Okay. That's great. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator
Our next question comes from Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory.
Tom Eagan
Thank you. First, a follow-up on Cubiware, could you give us a sense of how much it increases your market potential say in Latin America? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Tom Rogers
Well, we don’t have a specific project is to how much penetration it could garner for us. It’s in some major markets. It’s in Argentina. It’s in Brazil. It’s in Mexico. It’s in Panama. It’s in key pieces of the Caribbean. It’s in Uruguay. It is a company that as I said has been able to understand different competitive markets and being able to establish itself.
There, we obviously hope to be able to drive that for the reason to that Naveen and I just laid out. But it's not as if it isn't already a player in a number of the Latin American markets. And you probably know Latin America is a market we have been very focused on.
Derrick Nueman
And Tom, this is Derrick. I mean, think about just us hitting a much broader swath of the billion sub pay-TV market versus what we could hit before where we are focused on higher ARPU markets.
Tom Eagan
Tom Rogers
And we are also continued to be focused on the Latin American market in terms of TiVo's current solution, call it, higher end solution, because there is a obviously potential with a different level of operator for that kind of solution going forward in Latin America as well.
Tom Eagan
Great. Thanks. And then on the OTA service and device, how have the sales been of the device?
And secondly, what have you learned about the price elasticity of these subscribers? How technical, friendly they are, of these 10 million to 15 million OTA, OTT subs? Thanks.
Tom Rogers
Well, I would say the OTA subscribers have contributed to the uptick in trends on the retail business which were trends we hope will continue. We haven’t done yet what I would call any major marketing of OTA, but the price point that's been available at $49 has certainly been something that has gotten significant attention among both Amazon and Best Buy customers.
I will say that something very significant has happened since we really started down this path. When we started down the path, it was really coming off the back of the Aereo decision where service have been shutdown and there was clearly an appetite among some viewers to have some recording capability just for network television shows where they were paying for DVR, but they were not having to pay for their content, but wanted the recording capability for that.
What's happened in the last three or four months clearly is with the amount of new streaming services that developed, the focus on more and more streaming services available on an a la carte basis, the breaking down of the bundle and the pay package that is giving up all kinds of consumers more flexibility to put together their own bundle.
That the value of an OTA device to provide recording for certain programming and a streaming service integration point for others, all in a single interface with search across it all with mobile streaming capability as well, that's kind of opening up a whole new view of how people can look at the OTA not just as recording device for over-the-air signal, but as a key foundation for putting together their own bundles and packages.
And I think that view of the OTA product is one that will be more and more prevalent going forward. And as we think about more significant marketing of the OTA product, I think you will see that being a key part of it as well.
Tom Eagan
Our next question comes from Rich Tullo with A.F. Co.
Richard Tullo
Yes. How are you doing? It’s Rich Tullo. Okay. My big question is here on the Cubiware is, is that more in line with a real networks type of -- active video networks type of solution, or is it different? If you could just provide a little color on what they are doing so we could better understand the business?
And then my second question is on R&D and marketing spend. R&D spend seems to be still pretty high relative to where it's been, and marketing spend is very low. With the introduction of the OTA product, does it make sense to expand that marketing budget beyond seasonally what you have done in the past?
Tom Rogers
So, on the first part of the question, with respect to the Cubiware technology and I think ultimately you are asking kind of cloud-based approach along the lines of active video or more traditional middleware approach. I think the answer is, it’s very consistent with TiVo approach which is one that does still rely on some element of local middleware on a set-box. Obviously, in this case, it’s a much lighter weight piece of software that's designed to run on very inexpensive hardware platforms.
But it does also have a cloud component that is highly valuable in terms of unlocking a number of features and we will be looking to expand the breadth of that cloud component with the integration of Digitalsmiths. So you ultimately have a truly hybrid solution.
Richard Tullo
But I guess, any client -- skinny client solution, I guess you would call?
Tom Rogers
Correct. Yeah, it’s probably a fair way to put in.
Naveen Chopra
On the expense side, we have been brining down our R&D expenses pretty regularly each quarter. This quarter they were down about 5% year-over-year. As we pointed to our other major European front beyond Poland and Cubiware is the operations offshore center which we established in Romania which we think over the course of the year will continue to reducing our R&D expense. And so I would say that that's progress that has been ongoing and we think it will continue.
On the marketing side, you're right, our SAC was at about -- in between the levels that it was last quarter and where it was a year ago, but it included some inventory write-off that without that would have brought it down much more substantially below year ago levels.
And I would say that we are focused on marketing efficiently and driving our sub base. But you're seeing a lot of improvement in overall retail numbers off of what has not been very significant marketing expenditure at all.
Richard Tullo
Yeah. So, is there a positive net present value of allocating more money to marketing at this time now that you have a product that's attractive to show to consumers?
Derrick Nueman
Hey, Rich. This is Derrick. We're always looking at those numbers and if we think we can drive incremental subs at a really positive value we will. But it's something we're continuing to work on and we'll talk when we do it.
Tom Rogers
But we obviously believe the improvement in the retail business is one of the important growth factors to look to in the business and with that, we obviously are prepared to support that business in a way that drives the growth.
Richard Tullo
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.
Mike Olson
Good afternoon. Couple of questions. First, what kind of cross-sell opportunities are you seeing for Digitalsmiths? I guess are you seeing an opportunity to drive growth from existing Digitalsmiths customers or is it more the other way around that you have a larger opportunity to get Digitalsmiths adopted by existing MSO subs? And then I had another one.
Tom Rogers
It's a great question. I think the cross-sell opportunity is most prominent in the international marketplace. In the domestic context, there's fairly distinct types of customers Digitalsmiths is focused on, the big tier one operators, the DirecTV's, Charter's, Time Warner's of the world, and they tend to rely on internally developed middleware solutions.
Outside the U.S., I think we see a lot of opportunity both with a traditional TiVo solution and obviously part of our motivation on the Cubiware acquisition is we think there's some healthy demand for a combined Digitalsmiths-Cubiware solution. And that obviously is more valuable than selling those two products independently. So, we are quite bullish about that part of it.
Mike Olson
Okay that makes sense. And then as far as additional MSO deals, I guess where do you feel like the most low-hanging fruit is geographically, is it Europe, is it Latin America? And then maybe just as part of that, what's kind of the biggest pushback that you're getting from potential MSO customers that you're speaking with?
Tom Rogers
We've got discussions in the pipeline in all geographies including the U.S. We've got some interesting things we continue to pursue here. And as we said in the past, we're very focused on expanding our footprint both in Europe and Latin America.
The Cubiware acquisition will obviously take us into some geographies that would not have traditionally been optimal with the TiVo solution that we deployed in the first world, highly sophisticated operators.
So, that pipeline remains strong and frankly the issues are the same issues that we've had in the past, which is it's very difficult to predict when decisions get made. There's a lot of volatility to that and I expect that will continue to be the case. Although, one of the nice things with Cubiware is that by going after some of the slightly smaller operators, as we've seen in the domestic market, some of that can be executed more quickly.
Naveen Chopra
To your question of pushback, Cubiware takes the biggest pushback off the table with the somewhat smaller operators internationally, the biggest pushback we got was the cost of the full-blown TiVo service and this gives us a great answer to those who were pushing back on that basis.
Mike Olson
Tim Quillin
The patent monetization from a little bit of a different angle, but you developed -- may have been weeks, but TiVo by God invented the DVR, pay TV providers took that technology. You successfully sued and won and the agreements expire in 2018.
You're not necessarily a patent monetization company at your heart and those won't be renewals in 2018. They'll have to be new patent campaigns. And there will have to be campaigns against companies that you're selling product to and could strain the relationship if you're asserting new patents. So, how -- what specific way would you take to build a new patent monetization business at that time?
Tom Rogers
Well, we've been pretty successful with monetizing our patents without in any way suggesting against whom we might pursue patent issues or how we might pursue patent issues or when we might pursue patent issues. Only to say that we have extensive and growing patent position and if we believe that our patents are not being respected and we are not able to capture that value in the course of an operating relationship, which is our preferred course for how to capture value that we're prepared to pursue enforcement of our IP, if necessary.
And there are many variables that go into that, many calculations that go into it. I think we demonstrated that we were quite sophisticated in managing our IP monetization and I think all we can offer is to say that we believe there's substantial value there.
Tim Quillin
Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the guidance, so I'm hearing quarter-over-quarter higher revenue, lower operating expenses, there should be a mix benefit because of less hardware sales, but the midpoint of the net income guidance is 8.5 million versus 7.9 million in the fiscal first quarter which doesn't seem like a lot of growth, given that backdrop. So, what am I missing or maybes especially on the gross margin side, what might I be missing that might be less positive?
Naveen Chopra
I think as you said, you got to adjust for the -- our forecasted change in hardware margins, as part of that, and I think there are some -- I mean the rest of it's pretty much consistent. I mean margins are improving a little bit and I think if you look at the flow from revenue down to net income that pretty much explains the guidance.
Tom Rogers
And Tim, in Naveen's script, I mean we did say that revenue was going to grow based on our MSO business and our digital -- MSO business and growing. But we did also say that we're going to have technology revenue.
And if you remember, increases in technology revenue don't bring along margin with them. So, if we increase X million in MSO, it's very, very high margin. If we drop another 2 million in tech revenue, we're not really seeing a margin associated with that. So, that's what I think accounts for most of it.
Tim Quillin
Operator
Our final question comes from Andy Hargreaves with Pacific Crest Securities.
Andy Hargreaves
Thanks for squeezing me in. Just as a follow-up on the tech revenue, is that from getting to some sort of hurdles or is that all [indiscernible] with new business?
Tom Rogers
Sorry, we couldn't hear the question. Could you say that again?
Andy Hargreaves
Yeah. Sorry. On the tech revenue, the bump that you guys are expecting and actually the bump in the quarter two, is that -- you guys meeting hurdles that's causing kind of revenue to shift or is that new business that you guys are working on?
Tom Rogers
It's a combination of both. There's definitely some piece of it there that is projects that we have been working on and as you know, we were able to recognize revenue when we hit certain milestones. There's also some new projects that are coming into the fold.
Andy Hargreaves
And then just a clarification, it's said I think in the NPR [ph] that Cubiware had 40 customers across a variety of regions with 12 million pay TV subs, assuming that's total subs covered by those customers or is that subs number that they actually are serving at this point.
Tom Rogers
Operator
That is all for the questions. I will now turn the call back over to Tom for any closing remarks.
Tom Rogers
Thank you, everybody, for joining us. Strong financial quarter for us, I think the metrics make that clear. Strong strategic positioning from Cubiware to our OTA opportunity, I think you can see how we are pursuing strong strategic positioning across multiple fronts and just to reiterate, a strong formula going forward, more subs, more deals, lower OpEx, fewer shares. We see real value creation coming from that, more to come. Thanks for joining us. Talk with you soon.
