Rachel Maddow went after Senator Rand Paul tonight over a report he did not mention the shooting of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina when he was mere miles away from where the shooting happened.
Paul has been campaigning in the state this week, and Maddow said it would make sense for Paul to weigh in, because of how outspoken he’s been about criminal justice reform and disproportionate targeting of minorities.
And, Maddow pointed out, Paul has touted his own outreach to black voters in talking about broadening the GOP tent. So she was quite amazed that Paul did not mention the shooting:
“It’s gonna be really interesting to see how long does he get to keep getting credit for being a brave criminal justice reformer when he walks into the epicenter of a huge national discussion about race and criminal justice reform and he has absolutely nothing to say about it.”
Now, for the record, Paul did speak on the matter during a CNN interview yesterday. Paul did the interview from North Charleston, when Wolf Blitzer asked him about the shooting. Paul called it a “terrible tragedy,” said people should be careful not to demonize all cops as a result, and said it’s important to know the racial statistics of police shootings. He then talked about his criminal justice reform beliefs.
