A subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee has scheduled a hearing for June 2 on the problems that led to the recall of Takata airbags, which have been linked to at least six deaths and more than 100 injuries.
Takata, 11 automakers that used its airbag technology, and United States safety regulators are each pursuing separate efforts to determine the root cause of the problem, which has led to the recall of about 34 million vehicles.
Replacement inflaters that are currently being installed could eventually need to be replaced if it turns out that the real problem was not addressed before Takata began making parts to fix vehicles covered by the expanded recall announced last week, several industry officials familiar with the investigation said. The airbags can explode with too much force, causing shrapnel to fly out and hit drivers and passengers.
“If you don’t find out the root cause, who knows? We may have this same discussion again in four, five, six, seven, 10 years,” said David Kelly, a former acting National Highway Traffic Safety administrator now charged with leading a consortium of automakers investigating the Takata inflaters.
Mr. Kelly did not say how soon his group would finish its work. “It is apparent to us that we have a lot of work in front of us,” he said.
“We are confident that our new airbags are safe,” Takata said in a statement on Tuesday. The company has organized an independent quality assurance panel led by Samuel K. Skinner, the former United States transportation secretary. That panel is conducting “a comprehensive review to ensure Takata’s current manufacturing procedures meet best practices,” the company said.
The Japanese supplier has been investigating airbag problems for more than seven years but says it has narrowed the search only to “preliminary conclusions.”
Takata has said inflaters exposed over several years to high humidity combined with cycling between extreme high and low temperatures are at risk. Too much moisture can cause the ammonium nitrate in the airbag propellant to break down, increasing the risks of an explosion.
