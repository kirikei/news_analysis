ANNAPOLIS, Maryland — The Maryland House of Delegates has voted to ban powdered alcohol.
The House passed the measure 119-21 Tuesday.
It would prohibit the sale of powdered alcohol from June 1 to June 30, 2016. The measure now goes to the Senate, which approved a two-year ban Monday night.
The two chambers would have to agree on the length of the ban for it to become law.
The U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau recently approved several labels for a powdered form of alcohol that can be dissolved in a beverage. Several states have recently passed legislation banning it. Concerns have included abuse by minors and the potential to snort the powder.
Comptroller Peter Franchot last month announced a voluntary ban in Maryland between alcohol wholesalers and distributors.
