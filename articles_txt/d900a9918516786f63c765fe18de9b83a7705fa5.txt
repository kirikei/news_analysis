MINNEAPOLIS — Clay Buchholz allowed two runs in the first inning against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night then did all he could to give the Red Sox a chance to win the game. But it was too late.
Another lineup change didn’t work as the Sox were beaten, 2-1. For the third time in their last seven games, the Sox allowed three or fewer runs and lost.
Buchholz allowed two runs over 7⅓ innings but was beaten by Mike Pelfrey with the assistance of two relievers.
The Red Sox, 21-25, have lost five of their last seven games. But in the weak American League East, they are only three games out of first.
For Buchholz (2-6), it was more frustration. He has allowed five earned runs in his last three starts and the Sox have scored three runs in those games. For the season, the Sox are 2-8 in games he has started.
Buchholz has a 2.48 earned run average in his last four starts, dropping his season ERA from 6.03 to 4.33.
The Twins have won four straight, six of seven, and improved to 17-6 this month.
The start of the game was delayed by rain for one hour and 21 minutes. When it finally got going, Buchholz had a tough time in the first inning.
Brian Dozier led off with a double to left field before Torii Hunter drew a walk. Buchholz fell behind Joe Mauer but got him to roll into a double play.
With Dozier on third base, Buchholz could not end the inning. Trevor Plouffe, who had a three-run home run off Joe Kelly on Monday, doubled down the line in right field. Kurt Suzuki then doubled to right field to make it 2-0.
Buchholz has allowed first-inning runs in four of his 10 starts, 13 runs in all.
Over the next six innings, Buchholz allowed three hits and held the Twins down. Their only threat came in the fourth inning. But with the bases loaded,  Buchholz got Aaron Hicks on a double play groundball to short.
The Sox scored in the second inning. With one out, slumping designated hitter David Ortiz doubled to left field to snap an 0-for-15 streak. Ortiz was dropped to fifth in the batting order for the first time since 2012.
Eduardo Escobar, usually an infielder, misplayed the ball, although Ortiz hit it well.
Mike Napoli, who before the game was named the American League player of the week, followed with a shallow pop-up to center field that fell in for a single. Ortiz read the ball off the bat, got a good jump off second, and scored without a throw being made.
The Sox did not advance another runner into scoring position against Mike Pelfrey. Sandy Leon led off the third inning with a single before three fly balls ended the inning. Leon then singled with one out in the fifth inning before Dustin Pedroia grounded into a double play.
Pelfrey retired the final seven Red Sox he faced. He allowed five hits, walked one, and struck out four to lower his ERA to 2.77. It was only the second time in his career the righthander had faced the Red Sox, the first time coming in 2009 when he was with the Mets.
Blaine Boyer started the eighth inning and got two outs. Pedroia singled and Mookie Betts drew a walk. The Twins had lefthanded closer Glen Perkins ready and they went to him against Pablo Sandoval.
Sandoval, who is 2 for 41 batting righthanded, went up lefthanded and reached on an infield single up the middle to load the bases.
Hanley Ramirez had a chance but flied to right field. He has one RBI this month.
