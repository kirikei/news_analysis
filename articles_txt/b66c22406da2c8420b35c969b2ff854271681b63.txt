DENVER — Potential Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush is visiting swing state Colorado to have breakfast with military veterans and host a town hall about energy development.
Bush is traveling in the state Tuesday for his Right to Rise political action committees, which he's using to make contributions to Republican Party leaders in presidential battlegrounds.
Bush's first stop will be at an International House of Pancakes in Colorado Springs, where he's having breakfast with a group of veterans. He's then going to a downtown Denver hotel in the afternoon to speak to employees from energy companies.
Colorado is among the key battleground states both parties consider crucial to a path to a presidential victory.
