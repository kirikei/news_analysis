LANSING, Mich. (AP) -  Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's administration is backing off the assertion that the popular Pure Michigan tourism program would have to be cut as a result of the House Republican's proposed plan to fund road repairs.
Michigan Economic Development Director Steve Arwood testified Tuesday to the House Roads and Economic Development Committee in opposition to bills that would fund road repairs in part by using economic development funds currently funneled through the department.
Majority House Republicans propose taking $75 million from the 21st Century Jobs Fund. Some of that money supports the Pure Michigan budget.
Arwood says taking that money will likely mean other economic development programs are cut entirely to find other funds for Pure Michigan.
Committee members say that moving more money toward roads would support economic development.
