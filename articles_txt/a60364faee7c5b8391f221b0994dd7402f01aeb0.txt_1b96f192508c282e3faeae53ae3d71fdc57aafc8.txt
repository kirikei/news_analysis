ReCode, the news website led by the veteran journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, is being acquired by Vox Media, a deal that reflects the turmoil among digital organizations focused on covering the tech industry.
The all-stock deal, financial terms of which were not disclosed, will give ReCode access to a wider audience, something it has struggled to build since the site split off from The Wall Street Journal about a year and a half ago. Both plan to stay with ReCode after the merger.

The purchase of ReCode, which was announced by the companies on Tuesday, is just the latest significant move involving a digital media start-up in the past few months. In March, Gigaom, which had been one of the early sites dedicated to coverage of Silicon Valley, abruptly closed after nine years because of financial problems. (It said Tuesday that it planned to restart in August after being acquired by the start-up Knowingly Corp.) Circa, a news aggregation start-up, is trying to sell itself to a larger media organization after failing to raise more venture capital, according to two people familiar with internal matters, though recent talks with companies like Twitter have fizzled. And Pando, another technology blog, has struggled to attract a large following despite a splashy introduction announcing prominent writers.
Before its split from The Journal and its parent company, Dow Jones, ReCode was run as a site called AllThingsD, which, since its founding in 2007, had steadily built a following among technology executives. The site grew out of a popular conference business that became known for hosting tech luminaries like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. The conference business continued to grow and was an attractive part of ReCode’s portfolio for Vox.
But as traditional news organizations and upstarts alike descended on Silicon Valley, ReCode found itself somewhat lost in the crowd.
“Everybody is bigger than us,” Ms. Swisher said in a phone interview. “It’s not a secret that being a smaller fish is really hard.”
ReCode said it had 44 full-time employees and three contract employees. They were expected to join Vox, though Vox would not elaborate on potential staffing changes.
Since ReCode began operating independently, companies like BuzzFeed, Vice and Vox have each raked in tens of millions of dollars in venture capital while heavily staffing up on young journalists and aggressive advertising departments.
Despite developing a reputation for consistently breaking industry news, ReCode has struggled to draw significant traffic. The site receives 1.5 million regular monthly visitors, according to comScore.
ReCode will become part of Vox’s expanding digital empire, which includes the popular sports site SB Nation, as well as the technology site The Verge. ReCode also will gain access to Vox’s publishing platform , Chorus, which has been a key in luring marquee journalists including Ezra Klein.
Vox Media attracted 53.2 million unique visitors in the United States across its sites in April, according to comScore. The Verge alone had traffic of nearly 12 million, according to comScore, far greater than ReCode’s audience.

The size of that audience, especially for The Verge, was a particular draw for Ms. Swisher and Mr. Mossberg, who together controlled the majority of ReCode. In return, ReCode — with its access to technology executives and the ability to break major news stories — could lend The Verge more legitimacy. And while both sites cover technology, Nilay Patel, the editor in chief of The Verge, said they had different perspectives.
“The Verge is explicitly not a business publication,” Mr. Patel said. Rather, he added, the site “is about being a new kind of culture publication.” One recent article on the site was titled “How my girlfriend and I tried to fit the Apple Watch into our relationship.” Another headline, however, noted Uber’s raising of $1.6 billion in convertible debt.
ReCode closely covers the business of the technology industry, with frequent articles on financing rounds, earnings reports and executive moves.
The sites’ leaders acknowledged they could find themselves fighting over stories. But Jim Bankoff, the chief executive of Vox Media, stressed that an internal study indicated there was only a 3 percent overlap in content between the two sites.
For Vox, the acquisition of ReCode is part of Mr. Bankoff’s ambitious plan to create a kind of Time Inc. for the digital age, with a portfolio of publications that appeal to a wide swath of viewers. (ReCode’s existing investors — Windsor Media, an investment firm run by the former Yahoo chief executive Terry S. Semel, and the NBCUniversal News Group — will retain small stakes in the combined company.)
In the fall of 2013, Vox Media acquired the Curbed Network, which includes the sites Curbed, Eater and Racked. And in April last year, it started Vox.com , a news site led by Mr. Klein, who previously founded The Washington Post’s popular Wonkblog. Vox Media recently raised $46.5 million in a round of financing from General Atlantic, which valued the company at nearly $400 million.
In April, Vox Media announced it would begin selling its Chorus content management system to advertisers, allowing them to create so-called native content across the company’s sites — and also giving the company a new revenue stream. Mr. Bankoff said ReCode’s conference business would also bolster Vox Media’s bottom line.
“Our growth and momentum has never been higher,” he said.

Digital media company Vox Media, which publishes the Verge and Polygon, has acquired tech blog Re/code
Under new owner Vox Media, Re/code will continue to publish at recode.net and host tech conferences
Fast-growing digital media company Vox Media has acquired tech blog Re/code.
Vox, which also owns news sites the Verge, Polygon and Eater, made the announcement Tuesday. It said Re/code, founded by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, would continue to publish at Recode.net and across other platforms; Re/code is also known for its Code conferences, which bring together some of the top names in Silicon Valley for multi-day events.
"We have found a home for Re/code at a rapidly growing digital media company whose culture of quality journalism meshes closely with our own," Mossberg said in a statement. "This is by far the best fit for the future of Re/code and the Code conferences."
Swisher added that the combination would "give us access to the new tools and talent we need and want to make Re/code stronger and better."
Re/code was previously owned by Revere Digital. A purchase price was not disclosed.
Vox said that Re/code would benefit from its infrastructure and resources across production, marketing, communications, distribution, advertising and creative services, and would eventually adopt Chorus, Vox Media’s platform.
Its coverage areas will complement those of the Verge, which publishes consumer tech news and culture stories, by focusing on tech business news and analysis, Vox said.
Vox said Re/code's tech and business conference division would continue to grow and that it would "explore ways to apply Re/code’s leadership in this space" to its other media brands.
“Kara, Walt, and the Re/code team embody this same exceptional digital-first approach to journalism, continuing to set the highest bar for tech business coverage," Vox Media Chief Executive Jim Bankoff said.
Re/code launched last year after Swisher and Mossberg left their previous tech news site, AllThingsD.
Vox Media has seven media brands that collectively reach 160 million people monthly: Vox.com, the Verge, SB Nation, Polygon, Eater, Racked and Curbed.
