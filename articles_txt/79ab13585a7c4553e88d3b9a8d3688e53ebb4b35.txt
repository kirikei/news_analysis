A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a challenge to President Obama’s 2012 executive action granting deportation relief to immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children, upholding a lower court’s earlier ruling. A panel of the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the plaintiffs in the case, the state of Mississippi and a group of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers upset by White House directives, had not shown they had been sufficiently harmed by the rule. Mississippi had sought to show that it had standing as a plaintiff by arguing that illegal immigrants drained state resources, while the immigration agents said they were being forced to violate their oaths to enforce the law.
A version of this brief appears in print on April 8, 2015, on page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Louisiana: Suit Over Deportation Relief Rejected . Order Reprints | Today's Paper | Subscribe
