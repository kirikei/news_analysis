Every step along the way, David Price has been watching over Justin Verlander’s rehabilitation, imparting his wisdom from previously dealing with the same sort of triceps strain.
Price was there Tuesday, too — but his words of wisdom were saved for Twitter, as he live-tweeted Verlander’s simulated game at O.co Coliseum for those who couldn’t watch it.
“Sim game went really well!! Felt great! But the best part about it ... @DavidPrice14 live-tweeting it. Hahaha!!!” Verlander posted on Twitter after he was done throwing 70 pitches over 4 1/3 innings against teammates Dixon Machado, Hernan Perez, Bryan Holaday and Tyler Collins.
“Big Ver back on the bump!!! 3 ip 2 hits 0 runs 1BB 6ks...worked out of a 1st and 3rd 1 out jam w K and F8,” Price tweeted, along with a photo .

“Vers final line for sim game...4.1 ip 3 hits (all 1bs) 1 BB 9ks 0 runs...I don’t use the term domination lightly and he DOMINATED!!!” Price tweeted at the end of the session .
“Sometimes you have to tip your cap,” tweeted Holaday .
Verlander’s next step — as long as he feels OK Wednesday morning — will be a rehabilitation start (or two) as soon as next week, although the Tigers haven’t made any announcements about when or where.
