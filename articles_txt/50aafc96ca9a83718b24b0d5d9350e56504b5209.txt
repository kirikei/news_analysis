INDIANAPOLIS - Democratic schools Superintendent Glenda Ritz is one step closer to losing her position as leader of the State Board of Education.
The House Education Committee voted Thursday to advance a proposal that would allow the board to choose its own chairman, most likely ousting Ritz from her current position.
Lawmakers also approved changes that would increase the board's size to 13 members, maintaining the 10 seats currently appointed by Republican Gov. Mike Pence. A similar House proposal would keep the current structure of 11 members.
Those in favor of the GOP-led push say the change is necessary to fix a dysfunctional education board, while opponents call the move a political power grab that undermines voters who elected Ritz in 2012.
The bill now goes to the full House for consideration.
