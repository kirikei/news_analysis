Phillies GM apologizes to fans
Embattled general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. has apologized to Philadelphia Phillies fans for saying they “don’t understand the game” and the “process” that goes into constructing a team.
Speaking before the Phillies played the New York Mets at Citi Field on Tuesday night, Amaro said he probably used his words “incorrectly or poorly” and acknowledged they “caused a bit of a firestorm” in Philadelphia. He said his comments were not intended to disparage the team’s fans.
Already criticized by fans eager to see the club rebuild following consecutive 73-89 finishes, Amaro told CSNPhilly.com for a story published Tuesday that he thinks the Phillies will be conservative in promoting top pitching prospects Aaron Nola and Zach Eflin through the minors.
As for fans who want to see the team be more aggressive? “They don’t understand the game,” Amaro said, according to CSNPhilly.com. “They don’t understand the process. There’s a process. And then they bitch and complain because we don’t have a plan. There’s a plan in place and we’re sticking with the plan. We can’t do what’s best for the fan. We have to do what’s best for the organization so the fan can reap the benefit of it later on. That’s the truth.”
Getting a grip • Yankees manager Joe Girardi thinks Major League Baseball should avoid the sticky situation of pitchers being caught using foreign substances to get better grips on the ball by providing the tacky stuff for them. “I really believe there should be a substance behind the mound that every pitcher is allowed to use,” Girardi said Tuesday. “I’d like to see them come up with something that everyone can use when they go out there.”
Girardi’s endorsement of a rule change was supported by Royals manager Ned Yost before the teams played at Yankee Stadium. They spoke after two pitchers were recently suspended for being caught with substances on their arms.
Yost and Girardi acknowledged pitchers throughout baseball use substances that include pine tar or a mixture of sunscreen and rosin. “It just helps you grip a ball a little bit better,” Yost said. “It doesn’t make it do funny things, it just improves your grip.”
Reds • Starter Johnny Cueto will miss at least one more start after an MRI found inflammation in his pitching elbow.
Results Tuesday showed no major damage in the right elbow. Cueto, who won 20 games last season, had to skip a scheduled start over the weekend because of stiffness. Cueto is in the final year of his contract and hasn’t been able to reach a deal with the Reds, who could trade him at midseason if they’re still out of the race.
Marlins • A week after firing Mike Redmond and replacing him with Dan Jennings, Miami reassigned third base coach Brett Butler and replaced him with assistant hitting coach Lenny Harris. Butler will now work in the dugout and serve as the outfield and base-running coach. Jennings called any concerns over the decision-making by Butler “an internal matter.” Jennings said the plan is for Butler to help the Marlins “put the game in motion” while also helping read opposing pitchers.
