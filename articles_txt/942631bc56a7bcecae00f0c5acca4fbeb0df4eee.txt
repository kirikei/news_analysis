Due to the outrage stemming from the shooting death of Walter Scott, civil rights leaders plan to gather at Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference to press the Senate to confirm Loretta Lynch.
Spurred by outrage over the death of police shooting victim Walter Scott in North Charleston, S.C., civil rights leaders on Saturday will gather at the Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network annual conference to press the U.S. Senate to confirm Loretta Lynch as attorney general.
The NAACP, National Urban League and other groups are launching a campaign to end the “historic delay” in the confirmation of Lynch.
Lynch, who is the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, would become the first black woman to serve as attorney general.
