Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe signed an executive order Friday to "ban the box," removing questions regarding criminal history from Virginia state employment applications.
"Now if you were convicted of a felony," said Richmond radio personality Community Clovia. "You don't have to sign that box. You can go ahead and make that first impression and get your job."
The order directs the Department of Human Resource Management to "amend the state employment application to 'ban the box', removing those questions relating to convictions and criminal history."
"I care about this issue because I have a daughter who is 8 years old," said Clovia. "And she is going to grow up into a society where more than likely good girls like bad boys, but at least we want the bad boy to have a job."
The order makes clear that criminal history shall not be a determining factor in employment decisions, unless an individual's criminal history bears specific relation to the job for which they are being considered.
"In a new Virginia economy, people who make mistakes and pay the price should be welcomed back into society and given the opportunity to succeed," said Governor McAuliffe. "This Executive Order will remove unnecessary obstacles to economic success for Virginians who deserve a second chance."
NBC12 spoke to a local pastor who went to jail when he was 27-years-old. Robert Winfree now has a successful ministry.
"In my case it has been 40 years," said Winfree. "But there are still certain jobs that I am prohibited from working because of the fact that I was a convicted felon."
Some people on the NBC12 facebook page feel that is a good thing. Some feel banning the box "marginalizes law-abiding citizens." Others call the move "idiotic."
Rev. Winfree says he is living proof that you can turn your life around.
"A criminal is what I was," said Rev. Winfree. "It's not who I am."
