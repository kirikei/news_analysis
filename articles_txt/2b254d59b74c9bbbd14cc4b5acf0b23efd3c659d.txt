A group of 300-odd of mothers of jailed children have begun a hunger strike outside of an immigration detention center in Karnes City. EFE Agency reports :
“We have decided to unite and launch a hunger strike to show our desperation,” they said Friday in a message written in Spanish and signed by 78 women, all of whom are being held at the center.
The Karnes City facility, located some 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the city of San Antonio, Texas, is one of four detention centers in the United States for families, all operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
MSNBC reports that many of the children in the facility have been there for at least 10 months.
