Israeli planes strike targets in the Gaza Strip after rocket fire as a warning to the Hamas militant group
Israeli planes struck what the military described as four “terror infrastructure” targets in the southern Gaza Strip early Wednesday in response to a rocket that landed 20 miles inside the country the previous evening.
No injuries were reported.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility on the part of any Palestinian organization but Israel holds Hamas responsible for all attacks emanating from the Gaza Strip, Lerner said.
Hamas reportedly ordered its facilities cleared late Tuesday, anticipating a possible Israeli retaliation for the rocket attack.
As a precaution, the city of Ashdod announced that only schools sufficiently rocket-proofed would be open Wednesday and the neighboring community of Gan Yavneh, where the rocket struck Tuesday, began opening its public bomb shelters.
