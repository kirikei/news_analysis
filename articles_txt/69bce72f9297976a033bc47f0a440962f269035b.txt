BURLINGTON, Vermont — Vermont House lawmakers have joined objections to the kind of religious freedom law that generated a firestorm of opposition in Indiana.
The Indiana governor has since revised the religious liberty law to add language against discrimination after a national uproar over the law's potential impact on gay rights.
The Vermont House on Friday passed a resolution opposing the original law and requesting broader restrictions on taxpayer funded travel after Gov. Peter Shumlin banned all non-essential state-funded trips to Indiana for executive branch departments earlier in the week.
The Burlington Free Press ( http://bfpne.ws/1Ibillp ) reports that House members want the remaining branches of states government to be part of the travel ban and have it apply to the estimated 13 states with similar religious freedom laws.
