Romney, the Republican nominee who lost the 2012 election to Obama, is picking Duke to beat Wisconsin in Monday night’s final game.
The Huffington Post , which obtained a copy of Romney’s bracket, reports:
“Romney’s 2015 March triumph comes three years after he declined to fill out a bracket in the midst of the 2012 campaign. ‘I’m not plugged in well enough this year to do that,’ a deferential Romney said at the time.”
