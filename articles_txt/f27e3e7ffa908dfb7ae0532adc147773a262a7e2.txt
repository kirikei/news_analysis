President Obama’s preliminary agreement with Iran on its nuclear program has given Republicans considering a run for the White House a new and easy target to criticize.
Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was the latest to take aim, saying in a foreign policy speech on Monday at The Citadel in Charleston, S.C.. that the president’s negotiations had served to legitimize Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
“Should I run for president, and be so fortunate to be elected, one of my first actions in office would be to invalidate the president’s Iran agreement, which jeopardizes the safety and security of the free world,” Mr. Perry said.
Mr. Perry’s comments echo those of other Republicans who are mulling presidential bids.
Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida called the agreement “flawed” shortly after it was announced last week.
“Nothing in the deal described by the administration this afternoon would justify lifting U.S. and international sanctions, which were the product of many years of bipartisan effort,” he said.
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin called the possible deal dangerous, and over the weekend, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the only Republican to officially announce his candidacy so far, called it “doomed to failure.”
With Hillary Rodham Clinton having expressed support for an agreement, the stage is likely set for more debates on the topic in the coming year.
