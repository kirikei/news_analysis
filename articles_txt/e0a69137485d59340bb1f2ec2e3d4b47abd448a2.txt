High resolution cameras and ice-penetrating radar will be deployed on a robotic space mission to find signs of life on Jupiter.
NASA has chosen several instruments that will fly on-board a planned mission to Europa, an ice-covered moon of the planet Jupiter, considered a promising environment in the search for extra-terrestrial life.
Europa is a prime candidate due to the possibility of an extensive saltwater ocean beneath a layer of surface ice.
Europa program scientist Curt Niebur described the mission as “a giant step in our search for oases that could support life in our own celestial backyard.”
“We’re confident that this versatile set of science instruments will produce exciting discoveries on a much-anticipated mission.”
There are hopes that life may eventually be found surrounding geothermal vents on the bottom of Europa’s ocean, similar to how some aquatic creatures currently survive in the dark depths of Earth’s oceans.

The planned Europa mission will perform multiple fly-bys of the icy moon over a three-year period as it orbits Jupiter.
Thirty-three proposals were made for instrumentation, and NASA has selected just nine to fly on the Europa mission.
They include high-resolution cameras and ice-penetrating radar to directly image the surface and subsurface of the moon.
Other instruments will probe the composition of Europa in the search for organics, salts, acid hydrates and other materials.
An ultraviolet spectrograph and dust analyser will directly measure any water jets and other material ejected from the moon.
The data gathered by the Europa mission is expected to support an ambitious proposal to drill through the ice crust and into the saltwater ocean.
The mission is set to launch in the early 2020s
