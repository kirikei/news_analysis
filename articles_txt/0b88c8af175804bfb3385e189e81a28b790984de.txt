Humble Bundle teams up with Nintendo to launch the first console initiative with the ‘pay-what-you-want’ promotion.
Humble Bundle’s ‘pay what you want pricing’ has come to consoles, as which allows consumers to name their price for a collection of Wii U and 3DS games. The core bundle is called the Humble Nindie Bundle and requires a minimum payment of $1. The bundle features three games: Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition for Wii U, Woah Dave! For 3DS, and Mighty Switch Force! For 3DS.
Paying $10 or more will get you Stealth Inc 2 for Wii U and SteamWorld Dig for both Wii U and 3DS. Also, all consumers who pay more than the average price of Humble Nindie Bundle will also receive The Fall on Wii U, OlliOlli on Wii U and 3DS, and Moon Chronicles Episode 1 on 3DS, as well as more unannounced games that will be revealed as the bundle promotion continues.
As with previous Humble Bundle packages, the consumer can decide how their money is distributed between the developers, the Humble Bundle organisers, and how much to charity. With Nintendo’s deal, Code.org is the charity option. They are a non-profit organisation aimed at expanding computer science programs in schools and increasing participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.
The promotion will run for the next two weeks, and at this time, only available in North America and Latin America.
