The Ontario Legislature has passed a bill banning use of e-cigarettes in public places. Under the Smoke-Free Ontario Act the electronic device is now being treated as conventional cigarettes.
âItâs very clear that these things are the greatest harm-reduction devices that have been created to reduce the harm of tobacco,â conservative MPP Randy Hillier said in an interview after the vote. âFor the government to be a barrier and impediment, I find tragic and devastating.â
In the debate and discussion the pros and cons of e-cigarettes were highlighted.
About the cons question is put up about what the vapor contains and if follow the studies, various carcinogens is found in the vapor of e-cigarettes. More to this, short term inflamation and decrease lung function have been noticed immediately after vaping. Hence, the concern arises as what may be the effect of inhaling the vapors for twenty long years.
Similar questions were also raised decades ago in the 1930s and 1940s about conventional cigarettes. Now, the same mistakes are not to be repeated as there may be potential long term health risk.
Also, it is argued that e-cigarettes may act as a gateway product to smoking for young people. A report found that 15 percent of Ontario kids have tried the new smoking device when they are just between Grades 9 and 12. The reason behind this is the flavored e-cigarettes. It comes in candy flavored too.
Apart from all these, in Ontario it was also discussed the wide use of electronic cigarettes may also undo the benefits of current benefits of smoking in public spaces. Even, as of now, there is no regulation on the manufacturing of e-cigarettes.

A new Ontario law will see electronic cigarettes treated in the same manner as traditional cigarettes.
E-cigarettes cannot be sold to anyone under 19, banned in smoke free areas, and promotions and displays being regulated.
Ontario’s associate health minister Dipika Damerla says it’s an “emerging technology” with no evidence it helps break a smokers addiction.
However, should Health Canada gives it stamp of approval as a stop smoking option, the law could be changed.
