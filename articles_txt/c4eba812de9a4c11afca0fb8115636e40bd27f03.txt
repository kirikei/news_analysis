CLEVELAND, OH (WOIO) - Cleveland Cavaliers have announced guard Kyrie Irving will play and start in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night.
Irving missed the previous two games after an MRI test earlier in the month showed he has tendinitis in his left knee. Irving will be on a time-limit, however. 
The Cavaliers went 2-0 without him in the lineup. Backup point guard Matthew Dellavedova stepped up in Irving's absence, averaging 14 points a game. 
Irving aggravated his knee in Game 6 against the Chicago Bulls when he landed awkwardly on Tristan Thompson. He never returned to the series-clinching game. 
The first game of the 2015 NBA Finals takes place on June 4. 
If the Hawks can pull off a Game 4 victory, the series will continue with Game 5 in Atlanta.
