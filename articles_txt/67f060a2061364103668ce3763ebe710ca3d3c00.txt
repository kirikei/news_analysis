Q: What is the most important part of your new job?
A: Making sure we produce the best paper we can for our readers, online and in print. Figure out what our customers (readers and advertisers) want and give it to them. To make sure we are a positive force for all of San Diego and surrounding cities.
Q: What will be your first priority?
A: Figuring out what is the most important priority. The first few days on this job have felt like drinking from a fire hydrant! I think communicating the changes (most of them good) that will happen as The San Diego Union-Tribune changes ownership is high on that list. We need all the employees pulling in the same direction, not worried about their jobs or their benefits.
Q: You’ve done some integrating of newspapers before. How does this one compare?
A: The team in San Diego has been open, willing and amazingly helpful with the joining of SDUT to Tribune Publishing. There are some behind-the-scenes changes that will not impact the reader, but are a big deal to the employees who have to learn new systems and not miss a beat with their daily jobs. I have 100 percent confidence the readers of The San Diego Union-Tribune will see only positive changes.
Q: How did you decide on a career in newspapers?
A: I had a paper route in Madison, Wis., when I was 11 years old in 1971 and loved reading the paper before anyone else got it. I really liked how important the paper was to the people I delivered to. Many times they would be waiting at their front door for the paper. That made a big impression on me at a young age. After high school, I started at the local paper and fell in love with the business, again. Eighteen jobs, five states and 44 years later, here I am, still doing a job I love.
Q: What do you enjoy most about it?
A: The thing I love is that no matter what happened today, we get to do it again tomorrow. Hopefully better! You didn’t ask, but the thing I dislike is having to do it again tomorrow! It is amazing when you think about it. We collect, edit and verify news from around the world every day, and get that product to customers’ doorsteps by 6 a.m. every day. (Well, almost every day.)
Q: What’s your leadership style?
A: Open, honest and direct. Business isn’t all that hard, or complicated, though sometimes organizations can lose sight of that. If it works, keep on doing it. If it doesn’t work, try something else. We need to make it easy to interact with our business, easy to read the paper, easy to advertise.
