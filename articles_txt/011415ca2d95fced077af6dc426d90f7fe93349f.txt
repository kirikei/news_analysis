BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhuanet) -- The International Monetary Fund says Tuesday the Chinese yuan is no longer undervalued, after the previous note of "modestly undervalued".
The agency said substantial real effective appreciation over the past years has lifted the exchange rate to a level that is no longer undervalued. But it also said the country's current account surplus and forex reserves are too strong and called for policy reforms.
The IMF also predicted that China's economy would grow 6.8 percent this year, slightly below the official target of seven percent. Its call on inflation was 1.5 percent. Analysts say the inclusion of Chinese yuan into the agency's Special Drawing Right is highly probable if not a done deal.
