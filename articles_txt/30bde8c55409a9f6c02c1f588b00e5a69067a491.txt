Sunday:
(CNN) — “Photo bomb” and “NSFW” are phrases and acronyms you probably thought were just slang.
But guess what? They are now officially part of the English language, according to Merriam-Webster .
They are among 1,700 words added in the latest update to Merriam-Webster’s unabridged dictionary. Many of the new entries reflect global language trends that are increasingly digital, others reflect trends in cuisine and fashion.
Some additions are more foreboding, though, such as “colony collapse disorder.”
That phrase refers to sudden, inexplicable bee-colony death, a growing trend that threatens global agriculture.
