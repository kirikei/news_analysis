Health care has been extremely partisan in the Legislature these days but there was an unusual bipartisan concern expressed over a bill that would limit a taxing districts authority to levy ad valorem taxes if they have too many outstanding unpaid claims.
The bill cleared the committee but Republicans and Democrats both expressed concerns that the measure, HB 7115, is punitive to hospital taxing districts, whether they are independent districts or  dependent districts. The bill, to date, has no Senate companion.
