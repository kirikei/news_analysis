WASHINGTON — The military Thursday announced new steps to speed up weapons development, cut red tape and tap innovation in the commercial sector, and said robotics and longer-range arms could have a big part in securing technological superiority.
Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work said urgent action was needed after three years of “chronic” underinvestment in new weapons and capabilities leading to what he called a “steady erosion of our technological superiority.”
Chief arms buyer Frank Kendall told reporters the third installment of the department's “Better Buying Power” initiative was focused on shoring up U.S. superiority while further streamlining the often cumbersome defense acquisition process.
He said the department was about halfway done with an assessment of longer-range research and development priorities that would help shape the Pentagon's fiscal 2017 budget process.
Lockheed Martin, Boeing and other companies have been waiting anxiously to see what priorities emerge from a new “Defense Innovation Initiative” announced by then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in November.
Kendall said some key ideas had emerged for reframing weapons priorities, including a bigger focus on automation and robotics, greater collaboration among different weapons platforms and operating at longer ranges because of advances in missile technology by potential adversaries.
He said the department was being open about its eroding military edge because officials were worried about the lack of funding, and the threat of further cuts if congressional budget caps are not lifted in fiscal 2016.

We moderate comments. Our goal is to provide substantive commentary for a general readership. By screening submissions, we provide a space where readers can share intelligent and informed commentary that enhances the quality of our news and information.
While most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderating decisions are subjective. We will make them as carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers.
We value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments  either by the same reader or different readers.
We follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites.
We do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an article. In this case, we may fix spelling and punctuation.
We welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, but we don't want comments to become bogged down with discussions of our policies and we will moderate accordingly.
We appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles or blog posts point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all assertions. But these suggestions should be sent via e-mail. To avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or in an article.
