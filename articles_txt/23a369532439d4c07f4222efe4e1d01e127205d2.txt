TALLAHASSEE (AP) -- 
Republican Sen. Marco Rubio's expected entry into the presidential race will set off a series of announcements by other Florida politicians from both parties who want to replace him.
Rubio plans to announce his future political plans Monday at the Freedom Tower in Miami.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy didn't wait for the announcement before jumping into the race, but others will. That will likely include Democratic U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson and Republican Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater. Others considering a run are Republican Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera and Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis.
Democrats hope that an open seat in a presidential year will give them a rare statewide victory while the GOP seeks to put the fourth Republican in the seat since Democrat Bob Graham gave it up in 2004.
