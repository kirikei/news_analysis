After teasing it last week, Samsung today announced the Galaxy S6 edge Iron Man Limited Edition, a very special Galaxy S6 edge designed in collaboration with Marvel.
The Iron Man-themed Galaxy smartphone is dressed in red and gold, has 64 GB of internal memory, and will be offered in a box containing a matching wireless charging pad. A clear cover that enhances its "exclusive design" is also included. You can check out the handset in the photos and video embedded below.
According to Samsung, the Galaxy S6 edge Iron Man Limited Edition will be launched on May 27 in South Korea, and next month in China and Hong Kong. The company didn't mention other markets, which might leave many Iron Man fans disappointed. The price of the S6 edge Iron Man Limited Edition wasn't unveiled, but it's probably higher than the price of a regular S6 edge 64 GB.
