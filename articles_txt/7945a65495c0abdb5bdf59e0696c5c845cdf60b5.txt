Mitt Romney: I wish I’d bet $10,000 on my NCAA bracket. Shurtleff pitches himself as defense attorney. Dabakis enters SLC mayoral race.
Happy Tuesday. Back in the 2012 Republican primary fight, Mitt Romney joked at a debate that he would bet Texas Gov. Rick Perry $10,000 that he was right about his record, a comment that earned him some criticism over his wealth. Well, it appears Romney still has a pretty good sense of humor. Romney, who picked all four final teams in the NCAA championship and the winner, Duke, joked last night that he wished he’d bet $10,000 on his bracket. [ Politico ]
