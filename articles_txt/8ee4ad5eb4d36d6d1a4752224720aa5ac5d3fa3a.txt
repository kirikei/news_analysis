Nuclear energy advocates see Reid's retirement announcement as a game-changer.
The consequence of a congressional stalemate is clearly visible in the nearly 75,000 metric tons of spent radioactive fuel piling up in pools of water and steel casks that rest in the shadows of the nations nuclear power plants.
This isnt the way it was supposed to be. The pools and canisters were only meant to be temporary fixes while the Energy Department moved ahead with Congress more than two-decade-old plan to develop a permanent repository for commercial nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada  until President Barack Obama moved to kill the project in 2009 before it could open.
That decision was, at heart, a bow to the political clout of a fellow Democrat, Nevadas Harry Reid , the Senates majority leader at the time.
Now, at the dawn of the 114th Congress, two of the nuclear industrys biggest GOP benefactors, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, say they see a political opening that hasnt existed in years. Their seemingly modest aim is to keep the Yucca plan alive while funding pilot interim storage programs for the growing volume of waste.
As chairmen of the Appropriations panels that oversee federal energy programs, they are well-positioned to advance legislation. Reid has been relegated the minority. And the costs continue to mount, adding urgency to the debate.
Then there was Reids surprise announcement on March 27 that he will retire in 2016, a move that nuclear energy advocates see as a game-changer.
Despite all this, its quite unlikely that Alexander and Simpson will make much progress  at least in the short term.
Reid still wields significant power, even as a lame duck. Its unclear how many Democrats  if any  are willing to betray their leader in order to aid their states nuclear energy interests. Also, Reid has set up a formidable network of roadblocks to ensure « Yucca » wont move forward, even after he leaves Congress.
Weve had a lot of people that have been more important than me  including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton  who are opposed to this, Reid told CQ Roll Call in a March 18 interview.
Simpson and Alexander must also wrestle with a group of House Republicans who insist that getting Yucca back on track should be the sole focus.
The Yucca Mountain issue ... is dragging the whole effort to move forward on spent nuclear fuel, says Timothy Frazier, a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center who spent more than two decades managing nuclear programs at the Energy Department. Yucca is like an albatross around its neck.
Still, Yucca proponents say Reids planned departure will reinvigorate the nuclear waste debate in this Congress and after 2016  particularly once Senate Democrats are no longer beholden to Reid as their leader.
