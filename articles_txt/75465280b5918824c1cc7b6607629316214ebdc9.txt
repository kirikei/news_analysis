This little beastie weighs in at only 54 grams and it can move way faster than you would expect something of the size to move.
Humanity would not be where it is today if we did not learn how to work together, but robots have once again demonstrated that they’re much faster at adapting than United States because a robotic cockroach is now helping a robotic bird take flight without the need for a human to launch it. They’ve got the X2-VelociRoACH, which can scurry along most terrains at speeds up to 16 feet per second. VelociRoACH does not work that way, because its legs are coupled directly to its motors, so stride length cannot be dynamically varied. Since the legs can’t be made longer on this design, the team with increasing stride frequency. The limit to the stride frequency for the very small robot is due to structural failure. That means that the bot can run faster, but when it does parts break off. The team is looking at making new parts with improved materials to push the ‘bot even faster.
These tests were all carried out with an aerodynamic stabilizer (which had no effect on speed) to keep the robot runing mostly straight, and no dedicated steering system was implimented, as this was purely an investigation of top speed.
