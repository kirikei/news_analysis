Secret Service agents have had their mishaps behind the wheel recently , but they’re still offering driving lessons to the First Family.
Michelle Obama said Tuesday that Secret Service agents taught her older daughter, Malia, 16, how to drive.

Malia Obama (right, pictured with sister Sasha) learned how to drive from the Secret Service, revealed Michelle Obama in an interview with Rachel Ray.
"The Secret Service (taught her) actually, because they wouldn't let me in the car with her," the First Lady told television host Rachel Ray in an interview airing Thursday.
Obama said Malia sometimes drives outside the White House grounds, though not without a protection detail.
The First Lady said it makes sense for the agents to give the lessons, since neither she nor the President has driven since before his 2008 election.
Obama told Ray that driving gives Malia "a sense of normalcy.
"My kids have got to learn how to live in the world like normal kids," Obama said.
