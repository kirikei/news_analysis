Eight years later, the two-time NBA champions LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers are back to the NBA Finals. The Cavs massively defeated the Atlanta Hawks 118-88 series-clinching victory win in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday night at Quicken Loans Arena in Ohio, concluding the series in a comfortable sweep and clinching the franchise’s second Eastern Conference title and first since the four-time NBA Most Valuable Player LeBron James led the Cavs to the same achievement dating back in 2007.
The Cavaliers secured the East conference title without much struggles from the Hawks, the Eastern’s No. 1 seeder. After winning the Game 3 in a ragged overtime victory on Sunday, the Cavs got out to a massive lead early in Game 4 and dominated the proceedings.

LeBron has now matched that finish in his first season since returning to Cleveland Cavaliers as a free agent last summer and will now be looking to take home the ball club’s first championship. As noted by Howard Beck of Bleacher Report via the Elias Sports Bureau, LeBron James also recorded a career high achievement as the first player to make five consecutive NBA Finals since Bill Russell, Satch Sanders, K.C. Jones, and Sam Jones did so as members of the Boston Celtics’ 1960s dynasty. But James is just the first to do it with different teams.
Cavaliers will be playing off against the winner of the Western Conference Finals between the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets. The Warriors lead the series 3-1 and can wrap up the West finals on Wednesday night. Game 1 of the 2015 NBA Finals underway on June 4th and the Western Conference representative has home-court advantage.
