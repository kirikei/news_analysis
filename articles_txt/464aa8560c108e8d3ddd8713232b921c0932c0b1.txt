CHICAGO (CBS) — Fresh off his successful bid for a second term as mayor, Rahm Emanuel tried to squelch new rumors he might be thinking about working in the White House again, if Hillary Clinton is elected president in 2016.
At his first press conference to discuss his re-election as mayor of Chicago, Emanuel seemed more than amused by speculation, if Clinton were elected to the White House, she’d invite him to be part of her Cabinet.
“I just got hired for this job, the job I want,” the mayor said.
Emanuel said he wanted to set the record straight. First, he talked with former President Bill Clinton after he won a second term, not the former Secretary of State and First Lady.
Second, “This is the best job I ever had,” he said. “I have no interest in another job. Zero, zilch, none, nothing, okay?”

Emanuel also got a call from President Barack Obama on Tuesday.
“He offered me a Cabinet job. No, I’m joking,” Emanuel said.
The mayor even cracked himself up over that one.
Emanuel served as a senior advisor to President Clinton before serving three terms in the House of Representatives, and then became President Obama’s first chief of staff before moving back to Chicago for his successful bid for mayor in 2011.
