Pope Francis recently revealed that he has not watched television since July 15, 1990, ever since he promised the Virgin of Carmen that he would eschew it.
The Pope’s refusal to watch television, however, does not prevent him from keeping up to date with the results of his beloved San Lorenzo de Almagro football team, as there’s a Swiss guard who gives him the update on the team every week, reported The Independent.
The Pope doesn’t surf the internet and spends only ten minutes a day reading the newspaper.
Talking about his workload, he said, he felt that at present there were a thousand things to be done.
He also confessed that he misses the freedom of going for a walk and being able to pop out for a pizza from his pre-pontiff days.
