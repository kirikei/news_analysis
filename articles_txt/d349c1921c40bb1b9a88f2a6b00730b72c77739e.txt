Beijing and Washington are at odds over whether the U.S. has the right to send military planes and ships close to the Spratly Islands, where China is in the process of building a set of artificial islands.  International law – the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea — only goes so far in determining who’s right.
What Are China’s Claims?
China says it has sovereignty over virtually all South China Sea islands and their adjacent waters. It hasn’t defined those waters, but it issued a map that has what is called a nine-dash line that swoops down past Vietnam and the Philippines, and toward Indonesia, encompassing virtually all of the South China Sea. It has also never clearly explained whether the nine-dash line represents a historical or a legal claim – an important distinction under international law. China says its claim won’t hinder commercial vessels from passing through what is one of the world’s most important shipping routes, but it says foreign military ships shouldn’t conduct operations in the waters it claims.
Why Does That Trouble The U.S.?
The U.S. claims the right for its warships and aircraft to conduct military operations in and over what it sees as international waters. Its forces regularly carry out surveillance and other missions close to China’s coast. China has suggested the U.S. would cross an important line if it sends warships too close to the Spratlys. Because China has been vague about its claims, U.S. officials say Beijing could in theory one day seek to restrict access to some foreign commercial vessels as well. The U.S. counts the Philippines as an ally, and it is obliged under U.S. law to help Taiwan defend itself. Both governments have claims in the area as well.
What Does International Law Say?
International maritime law is complicated. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, every country has the right to control territorial waters stretching out 12 nautical miles from its coast. They can also claim an exclusive economic zone extending up to 200 nautical miles, within which they can regulate economic activity like fishing and mining. Foreign warships can pass through a country’s territorial waters in what the law calls innocent passage but can’t conduct operations there, according to the convention. It doesn’t specify what activities foreign warships can undertake in the exclusive economic zone.
How Do the New Islands Change the Equation?
The U.S. and China’s neighbors fear Beijing will use the artificial islands it is building to bolster its claims to the area – and assert those claims by force. The U.N. Convention says states can build artificial islands in their exclusive economic zones, but it says countries can base their claims to maritime rights only on naturally formed land features. The U.S., its allies and some of China’s neighbors are concerned that China will declare an air-defense identification zone over the South China Sea, which it could use to challenge other countries’ aircraft in the area. Facilities on the new islands could allow its military aircraft to police the skies. A secondary concern is that the islands could provide a backup airstrip for Chinese aircraft carriers. The islands are roughly 1,000 kilometers from the main Chinese coast.
What Are the Flashpoints?
The U.S. is continuing to conduct surveillance and other operations throughout the South China Sea, including waters close to the Spratlys. It is also considering plans to send navy ships and aircraft within 12 nautical miles of the artificial islands, though U.S. officials say they haven’t done that yet. Meanwhile, the Philippines is challenging China at a U.N. tribunal, arguing that the nine-dash line has no basis in law. China is a signatory to the U.N. convention, but has rejected U.N. arbitration.  The U.S., alone among major nations, hasn’t ratified the U.N. convention, which to some extent weakens its position in taking Beijing to task.
