Jeremy Bernard is stepping down from his role as social secretary at the White House , a post in which he was tasked with organizing entertainment and events featuring foreign dignitaries and celebrity figures, along with official state dinners.
Bernard has been in the post since 2011, when President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama chose him, making Bernard the first male and openly gay person to fill the role.
Bernard plans to return to Southern California, where he lived and worked as California finance consultant for Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign. After the campaign, he served as White House liaison to the National Endowment for the Humanities and then senior adviser to then-U.S. Ambassador to France Charles Rivkin, before taking his current post. Bernard also has held jobs in Los Angeles at Mapleton Investments and Falcon Cable.
No successor has been named. Bernard will step down after the Japan state dinner next month.
