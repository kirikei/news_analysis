As part of a bill to lift local prohibitions on permitted gun carriers bringing their weapons into parks, the House of Representatives in Tennessee has added and approved an amendment that would ban bringing fake guns within 150 feet of schools .
The text of the amendment reads:
A person commits an offense who intentionally carries an explosive, explosive weapon, permanently disabled firearm, hoax device, imitation firearm, machete, or sword openly within one hundred fifty feet (150′) of the real property that comprises the grounds or facilities of a public or private preschool, elementary school, middle school, or secondary school.
Inclusion of “hoax device” opens up the prospect of any toy gun that looks realistic could violated the law.
