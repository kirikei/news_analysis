AURORA, Illinois — Democratic U.S. Rep. Bill Foster says he's not running for the U.S. Senate in 2016.
So far Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth has announced her bid to try and unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk .
Foster had signaled interest in running earlier, but in a statement Friday says he wants to avoid a costly and "ultimately unnecessary primary." He says it was a difficult decision but he supports Duckworth's run.
He says the military veteran has proven she's dedicated to serving the country. Foster of Naperville says he'll help run Duckworth's finance committee.
Foster first won office in a 2008 special election to replace former House Speaker Dennis Hastert , who had resigned.
He was re-elected, lost a term and was elected again to Congress in November.
