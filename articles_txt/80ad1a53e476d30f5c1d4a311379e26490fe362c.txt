Johnny Depp’s dogs may have escaped a death sentence, but the star could still be in the doghouse with Australian authorities.
Government officials confirmed the Pirates Of The Caribbean actor could face up to 10 years in prison or a maximum fine of A$340,000 for illegally bringing his two dogs — Boo and Pistol —into Australia earlier this month.
Depp’s pilot could also face up to two years in prison for his role in the undeclared importing of the dogs, bypassing the country’s strict quarantine laws, a Senate committee hearing in Canberra was told, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.
The country’s agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce had threatened to have the actor’s two Yorkshire terriers put down and gave him a two-day deadline for the dogs to leave Australia.
Depp and his wife Amber Heard were in Australia for the shooting of the fifth instalment of Pirates Of The Caribbean, Dead Men Tell No Tales.
