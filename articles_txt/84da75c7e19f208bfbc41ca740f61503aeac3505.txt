BOISE, Idaho (AP) - A bill to legalize oil extracted from marijuana plants to treat children with severe epilepsy is on its way to the Idaho governor's desk.
The House voted 39-30 to approve the bill on Monday.
The legislation has been dubbed "Alexis' bill" after 10-year-old Alexis Carey, who has a rare form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome. Supporters say the oil can reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in children with epilepsy.
But opponents say it marks a slippery slope toward medical marijuana.
The plan also prompted concerns that the non-psychotropic oil could cause problems with enforcing and prosecuting other drug crimes.
Marijuana extract oil is legal in 12 other states that have also banned medical marijuana.
Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter has not said whether he will sign the bill.
