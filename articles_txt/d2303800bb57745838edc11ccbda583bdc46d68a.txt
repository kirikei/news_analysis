Denver Mayor Michael Hancock led demonstrators in a march down the 16th Street Mall from Market Street to Union Station where they rallied for Stand Up 4 Transportation day.
Hancock and state lawmakers want congress to pass a long-term transportation funding bill. The current funding bill, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP 21), expires May 31.
The bill would help replace bridges, buy new buses, build new road and create new rail lines.
“Transportation is the lifeblood of our city,” Mayor Hancock said. “An affordable and reliable transit system gets our people to work, school and healthcare, then back to their families. It provides our businesses throughout the region with the infrastructure to flourish. But just as a strong public transportation system can provide our cities with a competitive advantage, a crumbling infrastructure threatens our economic future. That’s why cities are taking the lead to push Congress to reauthorize a long-term transportation bill that increases federal funding.”
Rep. Diana DeGette, a Democrat representing Colorado, also spoke at the rally.
The rally in Denver was one of several across the country.
