Hillary Clinton is moving toward announcing her candidacy for president of the United States as soon as this weekend, according to Democrats familiar with her plans.
The exact timing of any announcement is not clear, but this time frame is in keeping with widely reported expectations regarding her timeline.
After her defeat at the hands of Barack Obama in 2008, Clinton firmly said “no” when asked if she would ever run for president again. But, since then, her position has evolved.
In recent months, Clinton has been gearing up for her campaign. Behind the scenes, she has hired a robust team, including many of President Obama’s former advisers and strategists.
Her team also recently signed a lease for a new office space in Brooklyn, New York, which will serve has her campaign headquarters.
She will enter the race as the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , and is leading all her possible Republican opponents in early polls.
A recent ABC News-Washington Post poll showed Clinton ahead of potential Republican candidate, Jeb Bush , by a 54-to-40 percent margin in a prospective match-up, with even bigger leads against Sen. Ted Cruz , Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Marco Rubio .
