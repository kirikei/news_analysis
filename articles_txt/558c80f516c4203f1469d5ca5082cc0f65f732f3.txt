WASHINGTON – A Utah man who thought he was going to a meeting with a federal official to discuss veterans was stunned last week when the official turned out to be President Obama.
Because of mixed signals, Lance Futch, 26, turned up on Friday at a Utah Air force Base in a wrinkled polo shirt expecting to be led into a large auditorium to talk about how to get more jobs for vets.
Instead, he was ushered into an intimate setting with Utah’s senator, Orrin Hatch, and congressman, Rob Bishop, two chairs away from Obama.
“I was told that it was going to be an informal event — that it was going to be business casual,” Futch told The Post Wednesday.
“So when President Obama walked in the room, I’m looking down at my white polo going, ‘Well if I would have known this I would have worn my military blues or at least a suit and tie. I admit I was feeling a little underdressed at the moment.
“I was sitting there. Honestly one of the first thoughts to go through my mind is: My commander on the base is going to kill me for this. I should have known better.”
But Futch, an employee of a solar company called Vivint and a member of the Air National Guard, winged the situation with ease – and managed to get in a plug for his firm since his polo shirt was imprinted with the name.
“He asked me about Vivint Solar. I was able to tell him: ‘We feel like we’re leading a revolution in the solar industry. We also feel like we’re empowering people. We’re giving them wonderful careers in a growing industry,’” Futch recalled.
A company rep revealed the mixed signals on Reddit: “We thought they wanted a representative from our company in the audience. Turns out they wanted the representative for a special round table with the president. Due to this mix up we sent my friend…instead of the CEO.”
