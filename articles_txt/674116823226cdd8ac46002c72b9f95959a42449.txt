Foster kids, seniors affected in Missouri budget proposal
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.– Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon’s top budget official says a Senate proposal would cut funding and hurt services for seniors, those with mental disabilities and foster kids.
The Senate is expected to debate the budget starting Tuesday. The current proposal includes cuts from House recommendations to the three departments that account for nearly half of the state’s total budget.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Sen. Kurt Schaefer says the social services, mental health and health and senior services departments need to be more efficient.
But budget director Linda Luebbering says the departments are dealing with increased caseloads and costs and need more money to provide services.
