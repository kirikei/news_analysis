Kansas moving to tighten rules for cash and food assistance
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - Critics of tighter rules for social services in Kansas discuss how they expect those new, stricter policies to make daily life difficult for families who receive assistance.
Republican Gov. Sam Brownback emphasizes his goal of moving people from state assistance into paying jobs.
Legislators have approved a bill putting the new, stricter policies into law, so they'll be harder to appeal.
The House passed the bill on an 87-35 vote Thursday, a day after the Senate approved it, 30-10.
Those policies require able-bodied, healthy adults receiving temporary cash assistance to work or be looking for jobs.
Lawmakers added rules, too.
One bans using cash assistance for entertainment, cruises, spa trips, tattoos, body piercing's and consultations with psychics.
Another law would limit ATM withdrawals with those with assistance cards to $25 a day.
