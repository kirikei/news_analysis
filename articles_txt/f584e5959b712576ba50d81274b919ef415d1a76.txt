TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Religious objections measures in Arkansas and Indiana that prompted national criticism are similar to a law Kansas enacted quietly two years ago with the state's leading gay-rights group officially neutral.
Advocates on both sides see a shift in the political context surrounding the debate over protecting individuals, groups and businesses objecting to same-sex marriage on religious grounds.
When Kansas enacted its law in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court hadn't agreed to consider whether same-sex marriage must be allowed in all states.
Also, Kansas wasn't in the national spotlight until 2014 over an unsuccessful measure on same-sex marriage that critics said would allow widespread discrimination against gays and lesbians.
