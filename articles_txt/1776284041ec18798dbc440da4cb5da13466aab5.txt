Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a single of the GOP&#8217s talked-about candidates for president in 2016, says it&#8217s wonderful to have tolerance for homosexuals, but America desires to be careful not to make a particular class of persons with specific legal rights.
&#8220The good news is our society is moving in a direction of additional tolerance,” he stated, Mediaite reported. &#8220My concern about creating special legal protections is historically in our nation, we have only accomplished that in extraordinary situations. It doesn&#8217t seem to me we&#8217re in one of those moments right now.”

Jindal and state legislators are mulling over a provision that&#8217s simmilar to what Indiana passed, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. But critics get in touch with such bills discriminatory against gays – though supporters say the measures only reinforce what the Initial Amendment protects.
Jindal didn&#8217t speak straight to the specifics of his state&#8217s forthcoming bill. But he cautioned critics to tread carefully.
&#8220I have faith and confidence in the individuals in America and the individuals of New Orleans and the men and women of Louisiana to not tolerate discrimination, to not assistance corporations that want to support discrimination,” he said. &#8220So certainly we want to have a society where we&#8217re not discriminating against folks. I do believe we need to have to be extremely careful about generating unique rights.”
