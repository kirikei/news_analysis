ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Hackers infiltrated the website of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority and published pro-terrorist messages.
The site was restored by early Sunday afternoon, and it wasn't immediately known when the hack occurred.
The Press of Atlantic City ( http://bit.ly/1ynwKba) reports the hackers posted messages that included statements such as "I am Muslim and I love jihad and I love isis." Some of the text also referred to the Islamic State.
