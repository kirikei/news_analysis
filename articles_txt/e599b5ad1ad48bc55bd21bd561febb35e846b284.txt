CARSON CITY, Nev. (CBS Las Vegas/AP) — Nevada lawmakers are reviewing a bill that would require employers to give nursing mothers a time and place to pump breast milk.
Members of the Assembly Health and Human Services Committee were scheduled to discuss AB306 on Friday.
The measure would require public and private employers to give workers a clean and private place for pumping. The break time could be paid or unpaid, and businesses with fewer than 25 employees wouldn’t be required to comply if the measure creates an undue hardship.
Supporters say the bill would empower mothers who work outside the home to breastfeed their children. Proponents at the March of Dimes say the antibodies in breast milk stave off illness and can literally be a lifesaver.
Many mothers who return to work abandon breastfeeding partially or completely because they do not have sufficient time, or a place to breastfeed, express and store their milk, according to World Health Organization .
WHO also reports that adolescents and adults who were breastfed as babies are less likely to be overweight or obese, less likely to have type-2 diabetes and perform better in intelligence tests.
