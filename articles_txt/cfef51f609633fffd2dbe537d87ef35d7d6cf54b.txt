One person dies, six hospitalized after van rollover crash on I-84 in Union County
One person died and six more people were hospitalized following a rollover crash early Sunday on I-84 near milepost 274, 12 miles west of North Powder, in Ladd Canyon in Union County.
Oregon State Police report that it appears the crash happened just after 3 a.m. Sunday, and involved a white 2002 Chevrolet Express Van, with seven people inside.
One person was pronounced dead at the scene, another was taken by air ambulance and the remaining five occupants of the van were taken by ground ambulance to the hospital.
State police say that icy conditions on the road may have contributed to the crash. The police investigation is continuing, and the road in the area remains closed. For updated information about when the road will reopen, see www.tripcheck.com .
