CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — When rancher Cliven Bundy arrived at the Nevada Capitol with hundreds of supporters recently to urge legislators to pass a bill demanding state control of federally owned lands within Nevada's borders, it renewed a fight over grazing rights that turned into an armed standoff last year. But it also represented the latest push in a decades-old tug-of-war that surfaces regularly in political debates and policy discussions.

WHAT'S IN DISPUTE?
Several federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management, administer land within state borders that isn't owned by private or other public entities. About 4 percent of land east of the State of Colorado is managed by federal agencies, while that figure is much higher in the West and is more than 80 percent in Nevada.

WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED?

WHY DO SUCH BILLS COME UP SO REGULARLY?
___
WHO WANTS FEDERAL CONTROL MAINTAINED?
___
WHY HAVEN'T THE EFFORTS SUCCEEDED?
The bills are largely considered to be unconstitutional because they put state authority ahead of federal law.
___
IS IT REALLY THAT SIMPLE?
As a condition of joining the union, some states in the West agreed to give control of huge chunks of land to the federal government and incorporate "disclaimer clauses" in their constitutions.
Today, the federal government is like any other property owner, and states don't have the right to demand acreage any more than a renter has the right to demand control of an apartment, experts say.
To describe the bill moving through the Nevada Legislature, professor Ian Bartrum of the Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas said, "If there's a word beyond absurd, I would use that word."
