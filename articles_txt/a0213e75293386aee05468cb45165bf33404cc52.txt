LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas — The leader of Arkansas' Senate is speaking to the Political Animals Club days after lawmakers wrapped up a legislative session that was marked by a debate over a religious objections measure.
Senate President Jonathan Dismang planned to speak to the club Tuesday in downtown Little Rock. The group meets regularly to hear from elected officials and other political figures.
Dismang is a Republican from Beebe. He's speaking to the group after lawmakers recessed this year's legislative session last week. Lawmakers approved a revised religious objections bill Thursday after Gov. Asa Hutchinson asked for changes to an initial version that drew widespread criticism that it was anti-gay.
The Legislature is set to return within the next month to formally adjourn the session.
