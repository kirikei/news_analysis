A Singapore Airlines Airbus with 182  passengers and 12 crew on board reportedly fell 13,000 feet when it  lost power to both engines en route to Shanghai.
The airline has confirmed the loss of power and is looking into  the incident.
The Airbus A330-300 flight on May 23 'encountered bad weather at  39,000 feet about three and a half hours after departure' from  Singapore, the airline said in a statement.
'Both engines experienced a temporary loss of power and the  pilots followed operational procedures to restore normal operation  of the engines.
'The flight continued to Shanghai and touched down  uneventfully.'
It added that the Airbus A330-300 plane's two Rolls-Royce  engines 'were thoroughly inspected and tested upon arrival in  Shanghai with no anomalies detected'.
'We are reviewing the incident with Rolls-Royce and Airbus,'  Singapore Airlines said.
In a Twitter post late Tuesday, industry portal Flightradar24  said the flight, codenamed SQ836, 'lost power on both engines   13,000 feet before power returned'.
In a subsequent post, it said the plane 'lost both engines  during the cruise' while flying through a 'huge storm', pinpointing  an area in the South China Sea off China's southern coast where the  incident occurred.
SIA, Asia's third largest carrier by market value, currently has  29 Airbus A330-300s in its passenger fleet.
It also has a fleet of 19 Airbus A380-800 superjumbos.
The airline, along with its subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot, and  Tiger Airways, flies to 119 destinations across 35 countries.
Last week, Airbus warned of a technical bug potentially  affecting the engines of its A400M military planes that was  discovered during an internal test after one crashed in Spain.
