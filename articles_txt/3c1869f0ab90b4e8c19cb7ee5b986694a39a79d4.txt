(TRNS)—President Obama’s executive order that would prohibit federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity officially went into effect Wednesday.
White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett wrote an op-ed for The Advocate, praising the executive order, praising it as a step toward broader laws against workplace discrimination.
“This represents not only an important civil rights milestone for the LGBT community, but for our nation as a whole,” Jarrett said. “As President Obama put it while speaking from the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, this is ‘one leg in our long journey toward freedom’.”
In a blog post published on the Department of Labor’s site, Labor Secretary Tom Perez called the order a “civil rights victory consistent with our founding principles.” He added that the result of the executive order is a “more dynamic and inclusive workforce that captures the talents of more of our people.”
President Obama signed the executive order on LGBT Workplace Discrimination on July 21, 2014.
