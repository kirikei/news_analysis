Self-driving car slams into man while testing its ‘pedestrian detection’ feature
Bit awkward for Volvo.
One of their new self-driving cars was testing a ‘pedestrian detection’ feature when it rammed into someone.
The XC60 is seen reversing in a Dominican Republic car park.
It then accelerates forwards and smashes into a bloke with his hands in his pockets who put too much trust in the machine.
It left two men with bruising and minor injuries.
The car giant said the incident happened because the people who bought the Volvo did not pay for the pedestrian detection functionality.
Spokesman Johan Larsson said: ‘The Volvo XC60 comes with City Safety as a standard feature however this does not include the Pedestrian detection functionality.
‘It appears as if the car in this video is not equipped with Pedestrian detection. This is sold as a separate package.’
Good to know.
