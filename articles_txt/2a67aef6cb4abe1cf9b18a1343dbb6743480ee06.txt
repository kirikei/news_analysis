NASHVILLE, Tenn. –  Leaders of the National Rifle Association cite the new Republican majority in the U.S. Senate as evidence of the gun group's political clout, but they warn of looming gun-control efforts in the final years of President Barack Obama's presidency.
The motto of the NRA's annual convention this weekend is: "If they can ban one, they can ban them all." Organizers expect more than 70,000 people to visit the convention's exhibit space, meetings and musical acts in downtown Nashville.

Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president and CEO, called on Congress to enact a law allowing people with handgun carry permits to be allowed to be armed anywhere in the country.
Meanwhile, a few hundred protesters gathered nearby to decry what they called "fear-mongering rhetoric" by the NRA.
