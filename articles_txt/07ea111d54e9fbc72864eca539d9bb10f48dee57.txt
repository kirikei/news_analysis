Further confirmation that you shouldn't hold out for new easing from the Bank of Japan anytime soon.
Bank of Japan deputy governor Kikuo Iwata maintained the Japanese economy is recovering, with "a virtuous cycle from income to spending" aiding the economy.
Speaking in Sapporo, he said the global economy is picking up, which should be key to exports. Tourism is also increasing, helped by the softer yen. The negative impact from the April 2014 consumption tax increase is waning, and corporate profits are projected to improve.
Meantime, unemployment is just 3.5 per cent and the labour shortage appears to be growing, which should help wages to get a lift (see the charts below).
Mr Iwata said Japan's economy should grow " a pace above its potential from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2016."
If the BoJ ends up being too optimistic, as a number of economists anticipate , it could be forced to ease further. But at the moment it looks clear that new efforts are far from the minds of central bankers.
