Replacement Statues
The creation of the National Statuary Hall Collection was authorized by the United States Congress in 1864 to allow each State to provide two statues of notable citizens for display in the United States Capitol. Guidelines for replacement statues include:
The subject of the statue must be a deceased person who was a citizen of the United States and is illustrious for historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services.
Statues may represent only one individual and should represent the full length.
The statue must be made of marble or bronze. Replacement statues made of the same material as the replaced statue are preferred. Materials from domestic sources are preferred.
The figure in the replacement statue should be over life size, with a height between seven and eight feet.
The Architect of the Capitol will make recommendations for placement of the new statue with the least possible disruption to previously placed statues.
