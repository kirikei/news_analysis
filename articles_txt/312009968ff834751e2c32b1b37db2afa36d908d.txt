SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — The 70-year-old grandmother who owns a flower shop in Washington state and became a national figure for refusing to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding says she was surprised her actions gained such notoriety.
Barronelle Stutzman refused the couple in 2013, and her actions were among the first in what has become a nationwide quandary as more same-sex couples marry. Stutzman told The Associated Press that she considered herself "a little grain of sand."
In a February ruling, a Superior Court judge found that Stutzman's refusal to provide flowers because of sexual orientation violated Washington's anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws. She was fined $1,000, plus $1 in court costs and fees.
But Stutzman says she will appeal.
Stutzman believes the decision prevents her from practicing her Baptist faith.
