Volvo’s self-parking demonstration, which was recently organised in the Dominican Republic, did not go as it was expected. The vehicle reportedly knocked down a spectator, who was expecting the car to stop in time. According to the driver the City Safety function of Volvo was accidentally deactivated.
The City Safety feature is an autonomous braking system, which is expected to prevent collision when the car is travelling at a speed of 30 kilometres per hour. It consists of a laser, which scans roads for vehicles up to a distance of 10 metres. In case, some sort of obstruction is present in front of the vehicle, the car stops in time even if the driver fails to apply the brakes in time. The new generation braking system is also capable of identifying pedestrians and cyclists.
The video shows the spectator standing right in front of the car and was undoubtedly unaware that the system was not switched on. The driver also failed to react in time, which shows how much the driver as well as the spectator was confident about the electronics of the automated system. Safety systems like ABS, Lane Assist and City Safety have increased the safety on roads but do not replace the driver as a whole. These are present for helping drivers in those situations where the driver is unable to take control.
