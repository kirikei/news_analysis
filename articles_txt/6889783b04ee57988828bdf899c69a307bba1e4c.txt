Tuition freeze by 14 Pennsylvania-owned universities gets OK Associated Press |
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) â€” The board that oversees Pennsylvania's 14 state-owned universities is endorsing a tuition freeze sought by Gov. Tom Wolf.
But it is reserving the right to back out of the deal if Wolf fails to deliver the more than $45 million increase he promises for the state universities in the coming year.
The board of the State System of Higher Education approved a tuition-freeze resolution Thursday by a 9-8 vote. It rejected a proposal that would have made the commitment binding and not subject to what happens with Wolf's proposed aid increase.
The new Democratic governor is seeking to provide an extra $45 million for the state colleges in the next fiscal year and an additional $45 million bump the following year.
The 14 state-owned universities serve about 112,000 students.
