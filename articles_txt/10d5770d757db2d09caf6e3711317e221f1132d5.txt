BOISE – Gov. Butch Otter will wait until Monday to announce his decision on legislation seeking to repeal slot-like machines in Idaho.
Otter’s spokesman said the governor’s deadline is today to sign, veto or permit the law – which would repeal roughly 250 instant horse racing machines in Idaho – to pass without signing it. However, Otter will not publicly disclose his decision over the weekend.
SB 1011 passed with more than two-thirds support. That means lawmakers have the votes to override Otter if he vetoes the bill.
