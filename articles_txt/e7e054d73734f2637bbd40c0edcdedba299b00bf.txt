An online petition calling for an end to a tax on tampons and sanitary pads in Australia has garnered nearly 100,000 signatures, and drawn the attention of the finance minister and prime minister.
Campaigners are calling for women's sanitary products to be exempt from a 10 per cent goods and services levy in a forthcoming tax review.
"Condoms, lubricants, sunscreen and nicotine patches are all tax-free because they are classed as important health goods. But isn't the reproductive health and hygiene of 10 million Australians important too?" asked student Subeta Vimalarajah on her online petition.
The petition had passed 95,000 signatories at the time of writing Tuesday.
Debate over the petition opened up an apparent difference of opinion between Treasurer Joe Hockey - in charge of the tax review - and Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
Hockey had said late Monday that the tax should be lifted on sanitary products.
On Tuesday, Abbott responded however that taking GST off "goods, which are one way or another regarded as health products ... is certainly not something that this government has a plan to do," broadcaster ABC quoted him as saying.
It was up to the states and territories to decide on the tax, he explained.
