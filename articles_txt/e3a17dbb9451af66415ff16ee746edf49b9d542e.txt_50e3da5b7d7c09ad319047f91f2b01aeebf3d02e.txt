Purple ribbons fluttering from light posts around Sturgis are a reminder that it’s time for “Relay for Life.”
The event begins at noon Friday at the Sturgis High School athletic complex and continues for 24 hours.
Community members have been meeting, rounding up team members and gathering donations.
So far, Sturgis Relay for Life has 19 teams with 122 participants who have raised almost $15,500, said Holly Gushwa, local leader of Relay for Life.
Although battling cancer is anything but fun, Relay for Life celebrates victories over cancer with food, games, activities and entertainment in a family-friendly, community environment.
Friday, activities include a dunk tank from 4-9 p.m. hosted by the city of Sturgis team.    
The survivor lap, which begins at 6 p.m., celebrates personal victories over cancer, as other participants line the track to cheer on survivors. Caregivers are included in the lap and honor.
Jim Moshier of Sturgis, a cancer survivor, is one of the featured speakers prior to the lap. Moshier said he was amazed and “extremely honored,” to be asked to speak.
Following the lap, a survivors’ dinner is hosted by Sturgis Hospital.  
A luminaria ceremony takes place after dark. Candles in personalized bags are placed around the track, glowing in honor of those affected by cancer.
Relay for Life teams often camp near the track on Friday night as members take turns walking. At midnight, a balloon launch will take place.
A pancake breakfast is offered 7-9 a.m. Saturday even for those who don’t choose to spend the night. An auction begins at 9 a.m..
Proceeds will go to the American Cancer Society. Relay For Life is the world’s largest fundraising event to fight cancer.
