MINNEAPOLIS -- Another lineup change didn't make much of a difference for the ailing Boston Red Sox as the plate struggles continued for the team getting paid Major League Baseball's fourth-most expensive payroll. After Tuesday's 2-1 loss in Minnesota, the Red Sox rank in the bottom third of all teams in runs, hits and batting average two months into the season.
Something's not adding up, no matter how many lineup changes manager John Farrell has made.
"We got to keep putting ourselves in positions to score," Second baseman Dustin Pedroia said. "We keep saying that, but it seems like we're one swing away every game and that swing is coming."
That swing came off switch-hitting Pablo Sandoval , who was bumped up to the No. 3 spot in another lineup change, as he ripped a shot toward center off Twins' left-handed closer Glen Perkins in the eighth inning. However, second baseman Brian Dozier stopped the ground ball from reaching the outfield and held Sandoval at first to load the bases.
The Red Sox needed one more swing and didn't get it. Down 2-1 with two outs in the eighth, Hanley Ramirez left all three Sox on base as he came up empty for the fourth-straight at-bat. Ramirez is now 4-for-26 in his last seven games. Seeking a spark, Farrell swapped Sandoval and David Ortiz in the No. 3 and No. 5 slots in the lineup. The move produced only one hit from each batter.
"I would like to think our approach can be a little more concerted," Farrell said. "A little bit more concentrated."
Failure at the plate spoiled Clay Buchholz 's strong outing on Tuesday night. Buchholz bounced back from a rough first inning that saw three doubles by allowing just four hits in the next 6 1/3 innings. Though Buchholz has posted a 2.03 ERA in his last three starts, the Red Sox put up just one run in each game, all losses that push the pitcher's season record down to 2-6.
Boston has scored just two runs or fewer in nine of the last 14 games.
"It seems like we're running into a lot of guys that are throwing the ball well right now," Buchholz said.
That was the case with Twins' right-hander Mike Pelfrey (4-1), who mowed down nine-straight Sox batters before Pedroia's single to center started the comeback attempt in the eighth inning.
"You never want to take credit from a guy who has thrown the ball well this year in Pelfrey," Farrell said. "But still, I think we're capable of more than what we showed tonight.
"I’m not going to say we expanded the strike zone, but we hit a lot of pitchers’ pitches tonight.”
After Twins' starter Ricky Nolasco retired 15-straight Red Sox batters in Monday's 7-2 loss, Pelfrey breezed through 14 of 17 hitters in the middle of Tuesday's game and finished with just one earned run for the first time in May.
Moved down to the five spot, Ortiz ended his three-game hitless streak with a centerfield double to the warning track in his first plate appearance. He put a good swing on a deep fly ball to left field and grounded out the next two at-bats to finish 1-for-4 on the night. Following a seven-game hitting streak, shortstop Xander Bogaerts is 0-for-8 in back-to-back losses to the Twins.
"I think everybody is scratching their heads a little bit," Buchholz said. "But I don't think it brings any form of doubt into anybody's mind about what we think this team can do."
