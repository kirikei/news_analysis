Rockets’ Dwight Howard Avoids Suspension for a Foul
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard will not be suspended for Game 5 of the Western Conference finals against the Golden State Warriors after the N.B.A. decided to uphold his flagrant-1 foul. Rod Thorn, the N.B.A.’s president for basketball operations, said in a statement Tuesday that Howard was trying to free himself from Andrew Bogut when Howard “recklessly hit him in the face with an open hand.” Howard could have been suspended for Wednesday’s game if the N.B.A. had upgraded the foul to a flagrant-2.
■ Atlanta Hawks guard Kyle Korver will have surgery on his right ankle, which he injured in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals.
