Mayor Alvin Brown picked up endorsements Monday from City Council members Ray Holt and Stephen Joost.
Holt and Joost, both Republicans, crossed party lines to back Brown, a Democrat, who is running against Republican challenger Lenny Curry in the May 19 election.
Holt said Brown and his staff have been very responsive to constituent issues in District 11, which Holt represents, such as filling potholes and trimming trees.
Joost said Brown is the only candidate who has a detailed plan for fixing Jacksonville’s pension crisis.
