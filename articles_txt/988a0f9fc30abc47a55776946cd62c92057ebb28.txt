MILWAUKEE (AP) â€” Polls are open in Wisconsin on this election day.
Statewide, voters will decide whether to re-elect Justice Ann Walsh Bradley to a third 10-year term on the Supreme Court or to elect her challenger, Rock County Circuit Judge James Daley. They will also consider scrapping the 126-year-old practice of having the most senior member of the court serve as chief justice.
Patchy, light freezing drizzle fell as polls opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday. Forecasters say there's a chance the precipitation will stick around through the day.
Voter turnout is expected to be light. Only two out of every 10 potential voters are expected to cast ballots.
