LOS ANGELES -- The FBI and airport police were investigating a threat to a flight from Taiwan that landed at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday.
Airport police Sgt. Belinda Joseph said EVA Air Flight 12 from Taipei to LAX landed as scheduled at about 3:40 p.m. Tuesday.
 
The aircraft was later moved to a different location and passengers allowed to deplane just before 5:30 p.m., according to CBS Los Angeles.
FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said luggage would be screened and the plane swept by bomb sniffing dogs.
In a statement, the FBI said that the threat came by telephone, but neither the agency nor airport officials released details.
"All threats, regardless of known credibility, are taken seriously," the statement said.
The threat comes a day after at least half a dozen other threats were made by phone to international flights at airports in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
Authorities said the threats may have come from the same source and did not turn out to be credible.
In one case, U.S. military jets escorted an Air France flight into New York City after someone claimed a chemical weapon was aboard the aircraft, the FBI said.
