President Obama used an Easter breakfast at the White House Tuesday to call out what he viewed as unbecoming comments by fellow members of the Christian community.
"On Easter, I do reflect on the fact that as a Christian, I'm supposed to love, and I have to say that sometimes when I listen to less-than-loving expressions by Christians, I get concerned," the president said to a gathering of Christian leaders. "But that's a topic for another day."
Obama appeared to go off script in that exchange. He did not allude to whom he was referring.
