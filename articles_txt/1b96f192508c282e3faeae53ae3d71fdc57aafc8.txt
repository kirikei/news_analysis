Digital media company Vox Media, which publishes the Verge and Polygon, has acquired tech blog Re/code
Under new owner Vox Media, Re/code will continue to publish at recode.net and host tech conferences
Fast-growing digital media company Vox Media has acquired tech blog Re/code.
Vox, which also owns news sites the Verge, Polygon and Eater, made the announcement Tuesday. It said Re/code, founded by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, would continue to publish at Recode.net and across other platforms; Re/code is also known for its Code conferences, which bring together some of the top names in Silicon Valley for multi-day events.
"We have found a home for Re/code at a rapidly growing digital media company whose culture of quality journalism meshes closely with our own," Mossberg said in a statement. "This is by far the best fit for the future of Re/code and the Code conferences."
Swisher added that the combination would "give us access to the new tools and talent we need and want to make Re/code stronger and better."
Re/code was previously owned by Revere Digital. A purchase price was not disclosed.
Vox said that Re/code would benefit from its infrastructure and resources across production, marketing, communications, distribution, advertising and creative services, and would eventually adopt Chorus, Vox Media’s platform.
Its coverage areas will complement those of the Verge, which publishes consumer tech news and culture stories, by focusing on tech business news and analysis, Vox said.
Vox said Re/code's tech and business conference division would continue to grow and that it would "explore ways to apply Re/code’s leadership in this space" to its other media brands.
“Kara, Walt, and the Re/code team embody this same exceptional digital-first approach to journalism, continuing to set the highest bar for tech business coverage," Vox Media Chief Executive Jim Bankoff said.
Re/code launched last year after Swisher and Mossberg left their previous tech news site, AllThingsD.
Vox Media has seven media brands that collectively reach 160 million people monthly: Vox.com, the Verge, SB Nation, Polygon, Eater, Racked and Curbed.
