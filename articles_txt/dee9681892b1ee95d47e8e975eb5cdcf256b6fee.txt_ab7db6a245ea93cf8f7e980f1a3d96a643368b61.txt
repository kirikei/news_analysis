After answering questions about media, messaging and what he thought about diversity in tech at the Code conference in Southern California today (spoiler alert: he didn’t reveal much ), Snapchat* CEO Evan Spiegel was asked whether, in all its efforts , Snapchat had plans for an upcoming Apple Watch app.
He said no. “We ended up waiting to do Snapchat on the watch. Why would you look at a small picture [on your wrist] when you can look at a large one on your phone?” he asked. Spiegel revealed that instead of expanding to other platforms, Snapchat will focus on its three-pronged business strategy for now.  He categorized those prongs as: 1) Camera and photo editing tools 2) Communications (messaging) and 3) Content.
“What’s the next platform,” Walt Mossberg asked him, if not the Apple Watch, “Or is it just the phone?”
Spiegel did not confirm either way, but explained that whatever it is, “it needs to be a unique experience.” “It’s wild to me that the phone rings,” he said segueing, “It’s kind of annoying.” When Mossberg asked what would the phone do instead of ring, “We haven’t totally sorted that out yet …”
Spiegel, who is in the middle of a  press spurt , also revealed that the company was approaching 100 million daily active users in “developed” markets, and that 65% of those users were creating content, snaps, daily. Facebook, for comparison, has 936 million daily active users, and has said that 85% of its users use it monthly to create content.
Facebook itself doesn’t have an Apple Watch app, but Instagram, which it owns, does.
Snapchat, which now has 330 employees, has risen meteorically since we first covered it and has robustly bolstered it product offerings in the past 18 months: Launching stories, chat, live video and discovery.
Its recent funding rounds put its valuation at $20B  and its attractiveness has largely been due to the demographic that it attracts (young, mobile) and the robust engagement rates that it’s seeing on its content and associated advertising.
As part of the “Content” component, Snapchat recently rolled out Discover — a section of the app dedicated to expiring stories from partners like National Geographic and Cosmo. Reports from those partners are mixed, but some, like Cosmo, are still reporting millions of views a day on their stories.
Snapchat revealed  recently that its users are 9 times more likely to watch  its large video ads because they don’t have to rotate their phones. But some advertisers have expressed reluctance to pay for Snapchat ads that don’t record or transmit the basic kinds of targeting and measurement metrics that are accepted as standard in the industry. Still, the service has remarkable draw in the demo that is most sought after with advertisers: Youth.
“Making a great product is being in touch with how you feel about things,” Spiegel mused onstage about appealing to that demo. And right now he’s feeling not so hot about the Apple Watch, apparently.

Snapchat co-founder and chief Evan Spiegel said Tuesday he has a plan for an initial public offering and has no desire to field any acquisitions offers, like Facebook ’s $3 billion bid for the company nearly two years ago.
Spiegel’s comments, coming at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., were the first time he has publicly acknowledged the possibility of an IPO. He stopped short of saying when the company, most recently valued at $15 billion, might try to go public.
After four years, Snapchat now ranks among the most popular social-networking services in the world. Spiegel revealed Tuesday the company is approaching 100 million users logging in every day.
Spiegel added more than 65% of daily users are creating content on the app.
Snapchat has never disclosed an official count of its users. As recently as last August, the service counted more than 100 million users in total, including those who do not log on every day, people close the company told The Wall Street Journal at that time.
Social networking leader Facebook had 936 million daily users on average in March, and Twitter recently said close to half of its 300 million monthly users log on to the social site every day.
Spiegel is touting the size of Snapchat as he hopes to drum up interest from advertisers. The company has in recent months begun selling ads, the startup’s first stream of revenue, and will eventually launch a self-serve ad product, Spiegel said.
The company will eventually develop sources of revenue beyond selling ads, the CEO said. “Great businesses” have multiple forms of revenue, he said.
Snapchat has worked to turn its free messaging app into a moneymaking business after raising more than $800 million from a diverse group of investors.
When asked about the current climate around tech investing, Spiegel said he predicts a “correction” is coming and he has factored that into his plans. He notes, like many observers of the recent boom in fundraising have, that low interest rates have spurred much of the activity.
With its appeal to teen users, Snapchat aims to go beyond messaging and become a next-generation media business, Spiegel said. The company has partnered with media brands including ESPN and Yahoo on its Discover service, which shows news articles and videos that disappear after one day.
Spiegel, a 24-year-old, first-time entrepreneur, was also asked about his management style. The CEO’s desire to have a hands-on role with the operation of the company contributed to the departure earlier this year of Emily White, a former Facebook executive who served as Snapchat’s chief operating officer for less than two years, people familiar with the matter said at the time.
