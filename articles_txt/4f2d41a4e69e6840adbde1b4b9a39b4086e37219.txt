Washington: The Secret Service on Friday suspended a uniformed officer who was arrested in Washington after being accused of breaking into his ex-girlfriend’s home and threatening to assault her.
The officer, Arthur Baldwin, kicked in the door of the woman’s home and fled before the police arrived, according to court documents. He was armed, according to the Justice Department.
“My ex-boyfriend won’t leave me alone,” the woman told a police officer, according to the court documents.
The couple had been together for two years, the authorities said.
The episode was the second embarrassing incident for the Secret Service this week. On Wednesday, the agency said it had put a supervisor on leave after he was accused of threatening to assault a female employee.
The Secret Service said in a statement that Baldwin was assigned to its Foreign Missions Branch, and that the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility was investigating the matter. Baldwin’s security clearance has been suspended, the statement said.
Baldwin, 29, was charged with first-degree attempted burglary and destruction of property. He appeared before a judge in Washington on Friday and was released. The judge ordered him to stay away from the woman.
According to the Justice Department, the hinges on the woman’s front door were broken, and the door was dented and marked with footprint marks. Two windows were broken.
The woman initially spoke to the police, but then stopped cooperating. Baldwin said that he had kicked in the door, but that he had not broken any windows, the authorities said.
