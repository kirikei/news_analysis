The Record
U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez arriving Thursday at federal court in Newark.
Sen. Bob Menendez and a wealthy Florida eye doctor, accused of working together in an extensive bribery scheme, entered a federal courtroom separately on Thursday afternoon. Flanked by their attorneys, they sat at different tables but exchanged warm smiles and nods during a hearing in which neither man spoke.
Leaving the federal courthouse in Newark, after each pleaded not guilty to more than a dozen charges, Dr. Salomon Melgen hurried past reporters and into his waiting Chevrolet Suburban, while Menendez continued his defiance with a fiery statement.
Salomon Melgen leaves Federal Court Thursday.
The limited interplay between the two men only hinted at what will be a central question in the major political corruption case: Were Melgen’s lavish gifts and Menendez’s advocacy of Melgen’s business interests the byproducts of a close personal friendship or the fruits of a relationship built on influence peddling?
The case is likely to define the line between bribery and friendship, requiring prosecutors and defense attorneys to reconstruct duel­ing narratives about what sustained the longtime relationship between the powerful senator and one of his most prolific donors.
But on Thursday, the proceedings started with a routine hearing, even though it involved a sitting U.S. senator.
Menendez was ordered to surrender his personal passport, but was released without any further restrictions. Melgen posted $1.5 million bail, $150,000 of which was to be paid in cash and the rest by property used as collateral. The 60-year-old eye doctor, who wore a dark suit with a light blue tie, was ordered to surrender his two passports, to remove a gun collection from his Florida home and submit to drug testing and potentially to treatment.
A private jet owned by Melgen, like those used to provide free flights to Menendez 20 times since 2006, was ordered grounded. A Dominican national, Melgen traveled to the Caribbean country biweekly, federal Judge William H. Walls said, but now must remain within the continental United States. Melgen’s attorney, Maria Dominguez, said her client had voluntarily given up his license to operate the jet.
Early trial unlikely
The two men sat about 5 yards apart at tables perpendicular to each other. Before the hearing, Menendez, wearing a blue striped suit with a U.S. Senate pin on his left lapel, looked in Melgen’s direction twice and smiled at him. Melgen, who held his hands clasped on the table, nodded in acknowledgment. Later, each stood next to his attorney at the lectern as the lawyers individually entered not-guilty pleas on behalf of their clients.
Prosecutors allege Melgen provided bribes in the form of free flights on his private jet, vacations in a Paris hotel suite and a Caribbean villa, and nearly $800,000 in campaign contributions. In exchange, they allege Menendez promoted Melgen’s business and personal interests. New Jersey’s senior senator tried to help Melgen keep $9 million that Medicare said he overbilled the government; pressed the State Department to provide visas so Melgen’s girlfriends from Brazil, the Dominican Republic and Ukraine could study in or visit Florida; and pushed for federal pressure to sway the Dominican government over a port security contract Melgen owned.
The sole dispute between prosecutors and defense attorneys during the hearing focused on whether Menendez should be required to give up his personal passport.
Menendez’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said it made little sense for the government to request the senator’s personal passport be surrendered while agreeing to allow him to keep his foreign travel credentials for government-related business.
“If this were any other defendant, he’d be required to give up his personal passport,” U.S. prosecutor Peter Koski said. “We’re asking that he be treated like any other defendant.”
“He’s not just any other defendant,” Lowell shot back.
The judge agreed with prosecutors.
Prosecutors had originally sought $2 million bail for Melgen but agreed to the lower amount during discussions over the past few days, Melgen’s attorney, Maria Dominguez, said. She said Melgen also agreed to drug testing, noting that he has attention deficit disorder and is on prescribed sleep medication. Melgen will temporarily live in an apartment in West Palm Beach until a gun collection in his home is removed in the next two weeks; he also is required to give up his firearms licenses.
The next court date, a status conference, is scheduled for April 22.
Other cases cited
Menendez and his attorney told reporters after the hearing that the Department of Justice was wrong to bring charges.
“For nearly three years, the Justice Department has pursued allegations based on smears launched by political opponents trying to silence me,” Menendez said. “Now they have laid out their case. We will finally have an opportunity to respond on the record, in court, with the facts.”
His attorney, Lowell, cited several other cases the Justice Department has lost, including its case against former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens. Stevens, a Republican, was charged with failing to report gifts — something the government also is alleging Menendez has done. Stevens was convicted, but that verdict and the indictment were overturned after a whistle-blower said the government had withheld evidence.
“Prosecutors at the Justice Department often get it wrong,” Lowell said. “These charges are the latest mistakes.”
He said the investigation was “fueled by heavy-handed actions of agents pressuring witnesses and then it had more than its fair share of improper leaks to the press.”
Lowell said he had asked the Justice Department to investigate the leaks.
Prosecutors had given the grand jury that handed up the indictment one description of the relationship between the senator and Melgen, Lowell said. But that version didn’t include Menendez’s account, he said.
“Now they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a 20-year friendship relationship between Dr. Melgen and Senator Menendez was something else,” he said.

Two stem from donations Melgen made to a legal defense fund for Menendez, allegedly in exchange for Menendez’s influence, as the need arose. Three others involve hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations by Melgen to political committees backing Menendez, allegedly in exchange for helping Melgen in disputes with the U.S. government over millions of dollars in Medicare overbillings and with the Dominican government over a lucrative contract for a Melgen-owned port security company.
Three counts of honest services fraud. Two involve wire fraud for causing pilots on Melgen’s private jet to communicate to air traffic controllers across state lines on flights alleged to be bribes. And one alleges mail fraud when Melgen mailed a campaign donation described as a bribe.
Menendez was charged with one additional count of making false statements, for allegedly concealing the gifts from Melgen by purposely failing to list them on financial disclosure forms that senators are required to file annually.

His supporters have been working quietly behind the scenes since details of a pending indictment were leaked to reporters in early March.
The allies say they were inundated with requests to help once news of the indictments broke. They've since helped to coordinate numerous statements from local and national officials and launched a website: istandwithbob.com.
The site was paid for by the Menendez for Senate campaign committee and launched by a longtime Menendez adviser who managed his 2012 re-election campaign.
