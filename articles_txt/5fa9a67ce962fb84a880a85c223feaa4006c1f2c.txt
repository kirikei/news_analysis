Â

Oklahoma is one of 15 states to file a brief on Thursday, telling the Supreme Court to uphold the ban on gay marriage. The state of Oklahoma is also one of eight states listed on Thursday's filing where gay and lesbian couples can marry, after the courts struck down the ban on gay marriage. The seven other states are: Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, Utah and West Virginia. In 37 states, same-sex marriage was made legal by voter approval, legislative action or court decree. The states in the filing want to be free to make their own decision on the issue.
