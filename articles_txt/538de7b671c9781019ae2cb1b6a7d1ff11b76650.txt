SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Highway Patrol has released audio from the 911 call that led to the arrest of NFL defensive end Ray McDonald on suspicion of child endangerment and domestic violence.
A woman, who is identified as the mother of the alleged victim, tells a dispatcher that McDonald is drunk during a 911 call about 3:41 a.m. PDT Monday.
According San Jose Mercury News, McDonald violently broke through a bedroom door to get to his ex-fianc√©e and their infant daughter. The 6-foot-3, 290-pound lineman then tried to take the baby from her before leaving, according to the report.
McDonald was later arrested at a San Jose, California, home on suspicion of assaulting a woman who was holding the couple's baby.
The caller says she wasn't at the home but that her daughter told her to call police, according to the recording.
Later in the day, the Chicago Bears released McDonald.
The arrest follows a pattern of similar incidents.
McDonald's agent, Tom Condon, has not returned multiple calls seeking comment.
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.
