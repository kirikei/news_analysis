A Manhattan judge is expected to decide early this week whether to seal the courtroom in the trial of former Goldman Sachs programmer Sergey Aleynikov to protect the bank’s trading secrets.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance — who is trying Aleynikov for a second time in state court after an appeals court tossed his conviction on federal charges — alleges he tried to steal the secret sauce computer code that powers Goldman’s rapid-fire stock and commodities trading business.
A federal judge agreed to close the court during the first trial when Goldman’s mathematical formulas and proprietary trading strategies were discussed.
But there may be less sensitive information to protect this time around. That’s because some of the key evidence from the first trial, including a laptop and a flash drive the FBI seized from Aleynikov’s home, is inadmissable in state court.
Without that evidence, Vance’s office will need to convince New York State Supreme Court Judge Daniel Conviser that the court should still be sealed when Goldman execs take the stand.
The bankers who could be called to testify include former Chief Financial Officer David Viniar. Others include technology co-head Paul Walker and Aleynikov’s former boss, Adam Schlesinger.
The case against Aleynikov got off to a rough start last week for Vance when his team asked for a delay, saying it needed more time to line up witnesses. A frustrated Conviser granted a short delay but ruled the trial would resume on Monday.
