CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — When rancher Cliven Bundy arrived at the Nevada Capitol with hundreds of supporters recently to urge legislators to pass a bill demanding state control of federally owned lands within Nevada's borders, it renewed a fight over grazing rights that turned into an armed standoff last year. But it also represented the latest push in a decades-old tug-of-war that surfaces regularly in political debates and policy discussions.

WHAT'S IN DISPUTE?
Several federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management , administer land within state borders that isn't owned by private or other public entities. About 4 percent of land east of the State of Colorado is managed by federal agencies, while that figure is much higher in the West and is more than 80 percent in Nevada.

WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED?
___
WHY DO SUCH BILLS COME UP SO REGULARLY?
___
WHO WANTS FEDERAL CONTROL MAINTAINED?
___
WHY HAVEN'T THE EFFORTS SUCCEEDED?
The bills are largely considered to be unconstitutional because they put state authority ahead of federal law.
___
IS IT REALLY THAT SIMPLE?
As a condition of joining the union, some states in the West agreed to give control of huge chunks of land to the federal government and incorporate "disclaimer clauses" in their constitutions.
Today, the federal government is like any other property owner, and states don't have the right to demand acreage any more than a renter has the right to demand control of an apartment, experts say.
To describe the bill moving through the Nevada Legislature, professor Ian Bartrum of the Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas said, "If there's a word beyond absurd, I would use that word."

THEN WHY, AGAIN, DOES THIS KEEP COMING UP?
Washington state Republican Rep. Matt Shea has become a prominent voice in the fight for local authority over federal land, and says there are constitutional grounds for such a transfer. He says the Equal Footing doctrine in the Constitution means new states and older states are equals, and argues that unless Western states have more control over the lands within their borders that's not the case.
Other proponents of a transfer concede the state doesn't have power to carry it out. But they believe a groundswell of state-level action and cooperation among states can convince Congress to give over land.

ARE THERE OTHER STRATEGIES?
Erin Ryan , a professor and natural resources law expert at Lewis and Clark Law School in Oregon, said amending the U.S. Constitution is theoretically a possibility, but too rigorous to be practical.

WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING SMALLER?
___
AND BUNDY?
His dispute over about $1 million in grazing fees isn't over, even though federal authorities called off efforts to gather his cattle amid fears of bloodshed.
Bundy is rallying friends around the Nevada lands bill, while the BLM said it's pursuing the case through the legal system.
"Our primary goal remains, as it was a year ago, to resolve this matter safely and according to the rule of the law," the agency said in a statement.
