Kenyan Interior Minister Refutes Claims Police Officers Killed By Al-shabaab Militants
NAIROBI, May 27 (BERNAMA-NNN-KBC) -- Interior Cabinet Secretary (Minister)  Joseph Nkaissery has refuted claims that about 20 police officers were murdered by suspected Al-Shabaab militants in Yumbis village in Garissa County in northeastern Kenya on Monday night.
Nkaissery said here Tuesday that the reports were mere propaganda by the Al-Qaeda linked group, saying only one officer was injured when a landmine blew up a police lorry in the area.
Earlier reports had indicated that at least 20 policemen were feared dead following a deadly ambush on Monday night when they responded to a distress call by officers hit by a landmine.
The officers patrolling the area between Garissa and the Dadaab refugee camp reportedly hit an improvised explosive device (IED) on the ground.
On April 2, the Al Shabaab terrorists stormed Garissa University College, killing 142 students and six security officers during a day-long siege.
Meanwhile, the move by county governors to push for the devolution of security matters has been widely criticized by a section of legislators. Kandara Member of Parliament Alice Wahome says the push by the governors is tantamount to usurping powers of the national government.
She said county governments lacked the resources to ensure security for its citizens and took issue with remarks by the newly elected chairman of the Council of Governors, Meru County Governor Peter Munya, that top on the agenda for the governors was ensuring that security is devolved from the centre to the provinces.
