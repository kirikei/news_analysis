Hours before the NCAA men’s national basketball championship game, a source with the former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate leaked Romney’s bracket , which is pictured above, to the Huffington Post .
Romney picked all the Final Four games and their outcomes correctly, as well as six of the eight Elite Eight participants. Out of more than 11.5 million ESPN.com entries, his bracket is in the 99.8th percentile.
Meanwhile, President Obama, though winning the arguably more important contest between the two, trails far behind in the 40th percentile. Additionally, while Obama has famously been an avid basketball fan and player, three years ago Romney didn’t even fill out a bracket. This year, just one was enough.
As for tonight’s game, however, he picked Duke. Of course.
Correction: An initial version of this report said Romney was in the 99.98th percentile.
