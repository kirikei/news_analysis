WASHINGTON — Tens of thousands of people are gathering on the White House South Lawn for the annual Easter egg roll festivities.
President Barack Obama and wife Michelle Obama are hosting the activities on a sunny spring day in Washington. This year’s theme is #GimmeFive, which is part of Mrs. Obama’s campaign to try to get young people to be more active and lead healthier lives.
Monday’s events kick off at 10:30 a.m. EDT and include sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, and of course, the traditional egg roll.
The egg roll is one of the longest-standing White House traditions. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling.

After nearly 4 months of buildup and more than 3 hours of the stuff that counts, the #Cubs are 0-for-155 million. http://t.co/98mWH6nKig
