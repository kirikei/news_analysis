The Colorado House started debate on the state's $25 billion budget for next year by considering nearly 40 amendments.
Most of the amendments will fail. Among those rejected was one adding $1.5 million to public schools by removing funding from private prisons, and another sought to eliminate nearly $17 million for statewide student tests in math and English.
The Republican-controlled Senate approved the spending plan last week, with nearly every Democrat voting no after GOP lawmakers rejected most of their amendments.
The House is ruled by Democrats and they'll try to make their own tweaks. They're expected to take an initial vote in the evening and a final vote Thursday.
The budget takes effect July 1. Most of the spending goes to schools, colleges, health care and prisons.
