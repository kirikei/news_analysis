COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) – A runoff election next month will determine who will be the next mayor of Colorado Springs.
Former state Attorney General John Suthers and former Colorado Springs Mayor Mary Lou Makepeace were the two top vote-getters in a six-way mayoral election that ended Tuesday. Neither picked up more than 50 percent of the vote – although Suthers came close – so they will compete in the May 19 runoff.
Suthers got 46 percent of the vote, and Makepeace received 24 percent in unofficial results released Wednesday.
