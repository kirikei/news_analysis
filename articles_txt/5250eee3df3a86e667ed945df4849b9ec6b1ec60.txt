Gay                                                  marriage film wins CIFF competition
Cleveland--With over 100,000                                                  people attending this years Cleveland                                                  International Film Festival, one                                                  of the Ten Percent Cinema films                                                  took the Greg Gund Memorial Standing Up Competition, which honors films                                                  with a conscience.
The film that took the honor                                                  was Limited Partnership,                                                  about the 1975 marriage of Richard                                                  Adams and Tony Sullivan in Colorado.                                                  Now, 40 years later, the couple                                                  is still together, and the film                                                  makes sure that an early chapter                                                  in the history of marriage equality                                                  in the United States was told.
Anti-gay                                                  attorney willing to cross Supreme                                                  Court
Austin, Texas--An anti-gay                                                  attorney testified before the                                                  state legislature that Texas should                                                  obey the Supreme Courts upcoming                                                  ruling on same-sex marriage depending                                                  on what the court rules.
Jonathan Saenz, the head of Texas                                                  Values, spoke during a committee                                                  hearing on a bill that would ban                                                  state officials from giving out                                                  marriage licenses to same-sex                                                  couples or recognizing their marriages,                                                  even if the Supreme Court rules                                                  in favor of legalizing same-sex                                                  marriage nationally.
Saenz first came to fame working                                                  for the Liberty Legal Institute                                                  in 2005, but he became a joke                                                  last year when it was revealed                                                  that in his 2011 divorce, his                                                  wife had left him for another                                                  woman.
Rep. Sylvester Turner pushed                                                  Saenz on the issue, drawing comparisons                                                  to the attempt to keep same-sex                                                  couples from marrying to efforts                                                  to discriminate against African                                                  Americans. Turner is black, and                                                  pointed to Supreme Court rulings                                                  barring discrimination against                                                  African Americans.
The bill was left without a vote                                                  after hours of testimony, and                                                  may fall to an issue of finance,                                                  instead of to one of social justice.                                                  The legislation calls for moving                                                  responsibility for issuing marriage                                                  licenses to the Secretary of State,                                                  instead of to county clerks, which                                                  would take millions in revenue                                                  away from counties. Dallas County                                                  alone would lose $1.3 million.                                                  Meanwhile, technology and labor                                                  costs to the state would be around                                                  $1.5 million.
Oregon                                                  house passes conversion therapy                                                  ban
Salem, Ore.--The Oregon House of Representatives voted                                                  41 to 18 on March 17 to bar                                                  so-called conversion therapy                                                  from being practiced on minors.
Seven Republicans stepped across                                                  party lines to support the bill,                                                  which is now headed to the state                                                  senate.
California, New Jersey and Washington,                                                  D.C. have already passed bans                                                  on conversion therapy, while                                                  about a dozen other states are                                                  currently fielding similar bills.
Puerto                                                  Rico to drop marriage opposition
San Juan, Puerto Rico--The                                                  commonwealth is no longer defending                                                  it ban on same-sex marriage, Justice                                                  Minister César Miranda said at                                                  a press conference.
The announcement went along with                                                  a brief filed with the First Circuit                                                  Court of Appeals in Boston by                                                  Gov. Alejando García Padillas administration. The                                                  court hears federal appeals for                                                  the American protectorate.
The brief notes that the majority                                                  of federal court ruling on the                                                  issue have decided that bans on                                                  same-sex marriage are unconstitutional,                                                  and notes that the Supreme Court                                                  will be hearing the Sixth Circuit                                                  Court of Appeals cases that could                                                  set federal precedent, asking                                                  the First Circuit to hold off                                                  on oral arguments until after                                                  the Supreme Court rules.
The Government of the Commonwealth                                                  of Puerto Rico has a strong interest                                                  in guaranteeing the equal protection                                                  of the law to all persons, the                                                  brief reads. This includes eliminating                                                  all forms of discrimination and                                                  unequal legal treatment within                                                  the Commonwealths borders. Although                                                  the main Defendant, the Governor                                                  of the Commonwealth of Puerto                                                  Rico, has defended the legal definition of marriage as the union between                                                  a man and a woman, the aforementioned                                                  recent doctrinal developments                                                  in this area of law have led the                                                  Commonwealth to recognize that                                                  Puerto Ricos marriage ban must                                                  be examined through heightened                                                  scrutiny, whether it be under                                                  the Equal Protection Clause or                                                  the Due Process Clause.
The government had earlier argued                                                  that federal courts did not have                                                  jurisdiction over the matter,                                                  but the brief notes that the Supreme                                                  Court agreeing to take up the                                                  Sixth Circuit cases trumps that                                                  belief.
Chicago pol caught making anti-marriage comments
Chicago--Alderman Emma                                                  Mitts, representing the citys                                                  37th ward, came out against same-sex                                                  marriage at a candidate forum                                                  on March 21, despite the fact that Illinois has full same-sex                                                  marriage.
While she has voted with Mayor Rahm Emanuel almost all of the time,                                                  and Emanuel has expressed support                                                  for the citys LGBT community,                                                  Mitts said that she doesnt support                                                  the fact that we can have two                                                  women marry, two men marry and                                                  we then we pay our fees, she                                                  said, according to the Windy City                                                  Times. The tax dollars go and                                                  they get just the same benefit                                                  as a woman or a man and I dont                                                  that playing field is level.
The newspaper notes that increased                                                  levels of anti-LGBT violence have                                                  been reported in the neighborhood                                                  Mitts represents.
Mitts, whose comments were videotaped,                                                  accused her opponent, Tara Stamps,                                                  of stretching the truth to discredit                                                  her.

St. Johns, N.F.--As of                                                  March 17, there were 15 cases                                                  of syphilis confirmed in Newfoundland,                                                  mostly among gay men 20‑49,                                                  compared to 26 in all of 2014.
The provinces health department                                                  made the information public, worried about the increase in cases. The province is                                                  not large, and has a commensurately                                                  small population.
Eastern Healths Medical Officer                                                  for Health Dr. David Allison said                                                  that 10 of the 41 cases since                                                  January 2014 have also had HIV,                                                  and that the ulcers in initial                                                  stages of syphilis can make it                                                  easier for one to become infected                                                  with HIV. He urged condom use.

Indianapolis--The same                                                  day Gov. Mike Pence signed an                                                  anti-gay religious freedom bill                                                  into law, he announced a public                                                  health emergency for Scott County                                                  in southeastern Indiana.
Pence said that the 79 cases                                                  in Scott County were linked to                                                  injection drug use of the opioid oxymorphone,                                                  known by the trade names Opana and Numorphan.
The state does not allow needle                                                  exchange programs, which have                                                  been shown to lower the spread                                                  of HIV through sharing used needles.                                                  However, Pences declaration of                                                  a public health emergency will                                                  give officials some leeway to                                                  institute temporary programs until                                                  the outbreak is brought under control.
