The state of Oregon has released 94,000 emails involving the fiancee of former Gov. John Kitzhaber , who resigned amid scandal earlier this year.
The emails released Friday are messages between former first lady Cylvia Hayes and staff in Kitzhaber's office. The messages show efforts by Hayes and the governor's staff to respond to an onslaught of media questions about her consulting work for advocacy organizations seeking to influence state government.
The emails, released in response to public records requests, also include notes of support from friends and allies.
Kitzhaber, a Democrat, resigned in February, saying the influence-peddling allegations surrounding Hayes had become too much of a distraction. The FBI is investigating and has issued subpoenas for the emails and thousands of other records.
