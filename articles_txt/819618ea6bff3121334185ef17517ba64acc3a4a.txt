AUBURN, Alabama — Auburn University officials say a data security lapse left personal information belonging to roughly 370,000 current, former and prospective students accessible online for months.
Officials said in a statement Friday that information including names, birthdates, social security numbers and academic information was exposed online between September 2014 and March 2. Officials say the security lapse didn't involve any financial information.
Officials say the breach stemmed from the configuration of a device that had been installed to replace a server. Officials say the server has been secured and there is no evidence of misuse of the personal information.
Officials say people whose information was accessible have been notified by mail and offered two free years of credit monitoring and identity protection. The university is now reviewing its data storage policies.
