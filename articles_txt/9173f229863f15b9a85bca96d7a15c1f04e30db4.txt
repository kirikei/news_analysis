(RNN) – Sarah Brady, wife of former Reagan Press Secretary Jim Brady, has died.
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence announced her death on Friday, calling her a champion against gun violence and saying “her commitment and fiery compassion will live on.”
They did not announce a cause of death. Sarah Brady was 73.
"In the history of our nation, there are few people, if any, who are directly responsible for saving as many lives as Sarah and Jim," the Brady Campaign said in a news release.
"There are countless people walking around today who would not be were it not for Sarah Brady's remarkable resilience, compassion and – what she always said she enjoyed the most – her hard work in the trenches with this organization, which she continued right up to the very end."
The Bradys pushed for gun control laws and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was passed in 1993 as a result of their efforts. The Brady bill made background checks mandatory for gun purchases from a licensed dealer.
James Brady was shot during an assassination attempt on then President Ronald Reagan in 1981. 
He died in August 2014. His death was ruled a homicide as a result of the gunshot wound he received three decades prior.
