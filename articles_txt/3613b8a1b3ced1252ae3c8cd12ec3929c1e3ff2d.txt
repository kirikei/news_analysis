On the other hand, Mitt Romney’s bracket was more accurate than 99.98 percent of all participants in ESPN’s Bracket Challenge, correctly predicted Duke as the eventual champion, and if you think the former presidential hopeful isn’t enjoying this victory, you’re wrong.  (RELATED: Mitt Madness: Romney’s Bracket In Top .01% Of The Nation)
