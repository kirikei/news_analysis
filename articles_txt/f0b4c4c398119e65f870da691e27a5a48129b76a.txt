Rafael Nadal has managed to obtain a special privilege from the ATP as his request to the latter to not let umpire Carlos Bernardes from supervising his matches for a certain period of time has been granted.
Nadal later justified his action at the press conference here in Paris, saying that the issue isn’t about his competence, but more because they have had issues in the past, which made him go ahead with such a request. Read the full article here. 
Later that day, his main rival Novak Djokovic was asked to give his say regarding the Nadal incident.
Is it normal for a player to request ATP to not let an umpire officiate your matches? Have you ever felt the need to request something like Nadal did?
“No, never.”
“I never ever thought of something like that. Chair umpires are humans as well, and they too make mistakes. May be they are also sometimes not quite confident when they make certain calls and they are also required to strongly participate in the match; they need focus and attention on surfaces which don’t leave marks like clay, and you have to make certain calls, Djokovic explained.
He further mentioned that the time limit rule has put a lot of pressure on the umpires like how it do to players, and hence, it is understandable that they too go through tense moments and emotions on the court like a player.
“I remember some matches where i wasn't happy about how they did their job, but I never thought of requesting the authorities to not let a particular umpire to oversee my game ever or even for a certain time, whatever,” the World No: 1 opined.
“I don’t think that’s fair and they do their jobs as best as they can, and of course sometimes they do it better and sometimes worse,” Djokovic said, not taking sides with Nadal.
