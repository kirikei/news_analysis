CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - Nevada lawmakers are reviewing a bill requiring more online sellers to collect and pay sales taxes.
Democratic Sens. Aaron Ford and Ruben Kihuen presented SB 382 on Thursday to the Senate Revenue and Economic Development Committee.
The bill seeks to require Internet sellers outside the state to collect sales taxes if they complete a certain amount of sales inside Nevada or solicit sales through the Internet.
Ford said loopholes in current law put brick-and-mortar stores at a disadvantage compared with their online counterparts, especially as more consumers turn to online shopping.
Current law requires online shoppers who don't pay a sales tax to sellers to report and pay the taxes directly to the state, but Ford said consumers rarely do so.
