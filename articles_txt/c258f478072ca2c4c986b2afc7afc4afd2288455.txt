About the Kansas City Royals and All-Star voting

So the first returns are in on the All-Star voting and the Kansas City Royals have leaders at five positions : Catcher Salvador Perez , third baseman Mike Moustakas , shortstop Alcides Escobar and outfielders Alex Gordon and Lorenzo Cain . Considering Omar Infante , who has been terrible, is second in the voting at second base, it's pretty obvious that the Royals bandwagon gained a lot of extra passengers with last year's World Series run.
You know what though? It's not that crazy that all those players are leading their positions. Consider:
Perez: Third among AL catchers in WAR, after finishing second to Yan Gomes (who has been injured) last season.
Moustakas: Second to Josh Donaldson in WAR while leading AL third basemen in batting average and OBP.
Escobar: This is a bit of a stretch as he's eighth among shortstops in WAR after ranking fifth last season. But there's also no clear top guy, and two of those who ranked ahead of him last year have been injured (J.J. Hardy and Jose Reyes ) and two haven't played all that well ( Erick Aybar and Alexei Ramirez ). Jose Iglesias leads in WAR but he also has the grand total of 10 runs and six RBIs, so Escobar is arguably as good as any choice in a weak crop.
Cain: Thanks to his great defensive metrics and a solid .306/.355/.427 batting line, he's tied with Mike Trout for the AL lead in WAR.
Gordon: Ninth among outfielders in WAR after ranking third last season.
Eric Hosmer is also an All-Star candidate as is reliever Wade Davis , who has yet to allow a run, so the Royals could easily end up with five to seven All-Stars. They've had three each of the past two seasons -- Perez, Gordon and closer Greg Holland both years. What hasn't happened in a long time is a Royals player starting the All-Star Game via the fan vote. Perez started last year but only as an injury replacement for Matt Wieters . Before that, you have to go back to Jermaine Dye in 2000.
Anyway, it's a big change from 2014, when no Royals player finished in the top five at their position (or top 15 for outfielders).
