Los Angeles, in its increased efforts to crack down on illegal pot shops, has closed more than 500 medical marijuana businesses across the city in less than two years, City Attorney Mike Feuer announced Thursday.
Feuer said many of those shops were close to schools, child care centers and other sensitive sites, while others were disrupting the quality of life in neighborhoods.
"Our office has an extremely effective partnership with law enforcement and neighborhood stakeholders, and we've gotten momentum in our effort aggressively to enforce the will of the voters who enacted Proposition D,â Feuer said in a statement .
Proposition D, the city's medical marijuana initiative, prohibits pot shops from operating within a certain distance from public parks, schools, child-care centers and other facilities and limits delivery of medical pot to patients' primary caregivers.
Since Feuer took office 21 months ago, the city said it has closed 503 medical marijuana businesses, including 94 closures in the Central Bureau, 76 in South Bureau, 224 in Valley Bureau and 109 in West Bureau.
The City Attorneyâs Office also filed 245 criminal cases against 1,000 defendants. Criminal cases filed by the city attorney can be against both the business operators as well as the property owners.
In the past year, Feuer has also taken civil action, closing a medical marijuana âfarmers marketâ in Boyle Heights in July 2014 and filing an injunction against smartphone medical marijuana delivery app Nestdrop in December.
In addition, the City Attorneyâs Office said it has successfully litigated 40 challenges to Prop D.
