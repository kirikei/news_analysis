People who are allowed to legally possess a firearm in Kansas soon will be able to keep it concealed in public without a license.
Staff Wichita Business Journal
People who are allowed to legally possess a firearm in Kansas will, starting July 1, be able to carry hidden guns in public places without getting a concealed-carry license.
The Topeka Capital-Journal reports Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback signed a bill into law Thursday that ends Kansas' concealed carry licensing requirement. The licensing system, which will remain available for people who want to be able to carry a hidden weapon in other states, required an eight-hour training class, a background check and a licensing fee.
Businesses will still be allowed to post "no concealed carry signs."
