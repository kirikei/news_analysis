Guess who's coming to dinner at the White House?
Not as many people as you might expect. President Barack Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry Truman occupied the Oval Office 70 years ago.
Obama held seven state dinners during his first six years in office. At least two more are planned for this year. Truman held office for nearly eight years and hosted six state dinners, according to the White House Historical Association.

WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY ABOUT OBAMA'S RECORD?
It says Obama's overall level of engagement with foreign counterparts and the different ways he interacts with them are considered more important than the number of state dinners penciled on his calendar. White House spokesman Patrick Ventrell says a state dinner is one diplomatic tool at the president's disposal, but it isn't the only one.
Obama has met hundreds of times with his counterparts and other foreign officials in settings as formal as the Oval Office and as casual as a Hawaiian golf course.
