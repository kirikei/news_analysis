PHOENIX (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, will seek a sixth term in office in 2016, an aide said on Tuesday.
McCain, the senior senator in the Republican-dominated southwestern state, will formally announce his re-election plans at an Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry event in Phoenix on Tuesday, said his spokesman Brian Rogers.
The 78-year-old McCain, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, is seeking another term after taking over as chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee in January.
The Vietnam War veteran, who was held as a prisoner of war, has been a prominent voice on foreign policy issues.
In 2008, he ran for the White House unsuccessfully against Democratic U.S. Senator Barack Obama. On Monday, he told the Arizona Republic newspaper he would announce his candidacy at the chamber of commerce and industry meeting.
"The reason why I want to seek re-election is that there's a lot more to do, both for Arizona and the country," he told the newspaper.
McCain told the paper his health is excellent, and he noted that his centenarian mother is also "doing fine."
The Republican senator has been known for his willingness at times to work across party lines.
Last year, at a meeting of the Arizona Republican Party a resolution passed by a voice vote censured McCain for what his critics called his overly liberal record, in a sign of continued distrust of him by some conservatives in the state.
