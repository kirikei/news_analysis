After answering questions about media, messaging and what he thought about diversity in tech at the Code conference in Southern California today (spoiler alert: he didn’t reveal much ), Snapchat* CEO Evan Spiegel was asked whether, in all its efforts , Snapchat had plans for an upcoming Apple Watch app.
He said no. “We ended up waiting to do Snapchat on the watch. Why would you look at a small picture [on your wrist] when you can look at a large one on your phone?” he asked. Spiegel revealed that instead of expanding to other platforms, Snapchat will focus on its three-pronged business strategy for now.  He categorized those prongs as: 1) Camera and photo editing tools 2) Communications (messaging) and 3) Content.
“What’s the next platform,” Walt Mossberg asked him, if not the Apple Watch, “Or is it just the phone?”
Spiegel did not confirm either way, but explained that whatever it is, “it needs to be a unique experience.” “It’s wild to me that the phone rings,” he said segueing, “It’s kind of annoying.” When Mossberg asked what would the phone do instead of ring, “We haven’t totally sorted that out yet …”
Spiegel, who is in the middle of a  press spurt , also revealed that the company was approaching 100 million daily active users in “developed” markets, and that 65% of those users were creating content, snaps, daily. Facebook, for comparison, has 936 million daily active users, and has said that 85% of its users use it monthly to create content.
Facebook itself doesn’t have an Apple Watch app, but Instagram, which it owns, does.
Snapchat, which now has 330 employees, has risen meteorically since we first covered it and has robustly bolstered it product offerings in the past 18 months: Launching stories, chat, live video and discovery.
Its recent funding rounds put its valuation at $20B  and its attractiveness has largely been due to the demographic that it attracts (young, mobile) and the robust engagement rates that it’s seeing on its content and associated advertising.
As part of the “Content” component, Snapchat recently rolled out Discover — a section of the app dedicated to expiring stories from partners like National Geographic and Cosmo. Reports from those partners are mixed, but some, like Cosmo, are still reporting millions of views a day on their stories.
Snapchat revealed  recently that its users are 9 times more likely to watch  its large video ads because they don’t have to rotate their phones. But some advertisers have expressed reluctance to pay for Snapchat ads that don’t record or transmit the basic kinds of targeting and measurement metrics that are accepted as standard in the industry. Still, the service has remarkable draw in the demo that is most sought after with advertisers: Youth.
“Making a great product is being in touch with how you feel about things,” Spiegel mused onstage about appealing to that demo. And right now he’s feeling not so hot about the Apple Watch, apparently.

You might not have to hold your finger on the screen to view your snaps in the future, says CEO Evan Speigel.
“It’s annoying to hold your finger there,” said Spiegel, talking about the difficulty of longer video content on Snapchat. Because there’s a screenshot API now, Spiegel says that their initial ‘hack’ of having a user hold a finger on the screen to prevent screenshotting is no longer necessary. This could open up the door to longer form content in video or other kinds of media. He was reluctant to confirm directly that you wouldn’t have to hold your finger on the screen to view your snaps in the future, he did say it ‘could be’ in the cards.
Spiegel was talking in an interview today at the Code conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.
The finger-on-the-screen mechanic, which forces a user to explicitly interact with photos and videos to watch them, has been a core part of Snapchat from the beginning. Removing that requirement could significantly change the way it engages users. I’m of the mind that this intimacy actually acts as a flywheel for Snapchat’s reportedly high engagement rates. The intimate and immediate nature of tapping to activate and releasing to stop makes it feel like you have a real physical connection to the content. So a change like this could be interesting and would likely have to have a strong rationale internally — like live streaming or episodic video outside of Discover. It’s also a powerful selling tool when Snapchat goes to advertisers to tell them that they can literally make users touch their ads while watching stories.
Snapchat’s Discover tab, a separate product from its messenger, already plays back stories without you having to hold down a finger directly. Spiegel also danced around talking about live streaming, saying that they were watching and learning from products like Periscope and Meerkat.
For some background, a change in iOS 7 which broke the screenshot detection Snapchat originally used threw some doubt into the mix regarding its finger method. But the 11th hour addition of an official screenshot-detection API (essentially the private one made public) rescued the mechanic, which still exists in the app.
Spiegel also said that it has 100M daily active users in developed markets, and 65% of those users are creating content daily as well. Internally, says Spiegel, Snapchat measures its users in hourly fashion, an unnaturally granular way to look at these statistics.
In a recent interview, Spiegel said that more than 60% of all-important 13-34 year-old smartphone users in the U.S. are active on the service. And they watch more than 2B videos every day there. Those numbers mean that Snapchat (which is 1/10th the size of Facebook) video usage is very high. This means that one person on Snapchat watches five videos for every one person on FB. Investors are so impressed with those numbers that they  invested $485M more in Snapchat in December (which had just raised a few months earlier at a $100M valuation). This ‘rolling round’ has left them flush with cash and options — making them willing to experiment with things like ad formats and Snapchat Discover .
And part of that experimentation could lead to more or longer video content on Snapchat. Spiegel says that their forays into media publishing  are an experiment that allows them to understand what publishers want.
“When we started out building discover we talked to a bunch of people that created media…but that was insanely time consuming. We realized that we needed to do it ourselves. Now, instead of traveling and asking them we can walk across the street and ask what’s…not working.”
What they might have found was getting in the way? Your finger.
