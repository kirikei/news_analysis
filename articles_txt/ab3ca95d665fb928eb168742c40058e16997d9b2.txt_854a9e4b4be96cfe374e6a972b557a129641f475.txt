Out of the Loop at the French Open, and Liking It That Way

PARIS — The social media age is also the age of the spoiler alert. Surprise movie endings and abrupt plot twists could all be lurking in a timeline.
For many a professional tennis player, the dangers are even greater. Log on or scroll down at the wrong time in the wrong place and you might find out your draw — which, as anyone who knows tennis players can confirm, is often a no-go zone.
Serena Williams , Petra Kvitova, Victoria Azarenka, Sloane Stephens and Milos Raonic are among those who like to avoid the news as long as possible.
“I get stressed out,” Williams said Tuesday night after beating Andrea Hlavackova, 6-2, 6-3, in the first round of the French Open .
Others, like Andy Murray or Madison Keys, have no qualms about breaking down the possibilities. After Friday’s French Open draw, Murray, the British star, expounded at length on his half of the draw: the potential match between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals; the looming threats of David Ferrer, Nick Kyrgios, John Isner and David Goffin.
“If I had said nothing about it, I would have got told very quickly what my draw was,” Murray said. “I have realized that it’s pointless trying to keep it secret.”
Others beat on, boats against the current of information, and it is clearly easier for those who are not yet stars, and not yet summoned to post-draw news conferences, to keep themselves in the dark.
“I don’t go on Facebook, and I have my agent handle my Facebook page,” said Irina Falconi, an unseeded American player who advanced to the second round of the French Open on Tuesday. “Anytime I get a mention on Twitter, I don’t get notifications.”
Although Keys has started avoiding Twitter during tournaments in an effort to limit distractions, she said she did not mind looking at an entire draw. She ran into Falconi on Tuesday after Falconi had won.
“I just asked Irina who she played next round, and she’s like: ‘I don’t know; I don’t look at the draw,’ ” Keys said, throwing up her hands in mock self-defense. “I was like: ‘O.K., sorry. I don’t know who you play, either. I won’t tell you.’ ”

Avoiding the draw is often about superstition, but Falconi said her approach was designed to keep her focused on the present.
“My future opponent could sprain an ankle,” she said. “It doesn’t matter who you play next. It’s got to be point by point. There’s this movie and book called ‘Peaceful Warrior.’ What time is it? It’s this moment. It doesn’t matter what happens after. So that’s my philosophy. Like today in my match, my coach said, ‘Keep fighting,’ and I was like, no. Whatever happened has already happened. It’s about now. Now is a new moment. Let’s go from here. Let’s fight, not keep fighting.”
Raonic, the big-serving Canadian, agrees with that approach. “We are pretty much the only sport that plays 11 months out of the year,” he said in an interview last week after withdrawing from the French Open after foot surgery. “When you start really getting that kind of stuff in your head, stuff out of your control, it ends up tiring you out mentally. So for me, there’s no need to waste energy or stress over something that is beyond you. I think it is really important as a tennis player to focus on what you can control, because we have so many instances and factors that are out of our hands.”

Tennis players have avoided looking at draws for as long as there have been draws to look at. The draws were once posted exclusively on paper, usually on a locker room wall at a tournament. Then came the fax machine.
But the era of screen time is a much more challenging time. Dominika Cibulkova, missing the French Open this year as she works her way back from surgery, said she tried to navigate social media during a tournament but would “quickly click away” if she saw a posting that might address whom she would play later in the tournament.
“It’s not as hard as you might think,” she said. “I can click pretty fast.”
Kvitova said she started avoiding the Internet during events last year. “I could go into social media, but I click on the Facebook button, don’t follow for this moment,” Kvitova said. “But of course somebody can tell me something about the draw.”
That can have its downside for the messengers. Williams recently cut short a news conference in Madrid when a reporter gave her too much information about her section of the draw.
Or consider this news conference exchange involving Stephens, who had just reached the quarterfinals, at the Miami tournament in March.
Reporter: “Can you kind of describe your feelings about getting to the quarterfinal?”
Stephens: “Don’t tell me who I play.”
Reporter: “We don’t know yet.”
Stephens: “Don’t tell me.”
The most common strain of avoidance behavior is not to look too deeply into a draw, but Stephens does not even like to know whom she is playing next. “As far as I know, not until the day of the match,” said John Tobias, Stephens’s agent.
That might seem like a tactical disadvantage, but she is in fine company with Williams, a 19-time Grand Slam singles champion.
“If I figure out who I’m going to play in the first round, then I focus my game too much without even trying,” Williams said. “I’m like, Oh, her forehand is bigger, or her backhand is bigger. And I will just hit every shot there. Next thing you know, in Round 5 or Round 3, I’m like, I practiced too much to cater to that one person. I feel like, for me, I can play anyone as long as I’m focused on myself, and I just go for that.”
The result is an unusual routine in which her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, will scout an opponent but mention nothing to Williams about her identity or the right tactics until about 30 minutes before the match.
“It’s clear in her head that way,” he said Tuesday. “There’s no stress the night before, no overthinking the problem. I’ve never had a player like this before, but I actually think it’s a good idea. But she only does it for the first round.”
Or does she? On Tuesday night, with her first-round victory complete, the time came for the last question, and a reporter piped up, “What do you think about your next opponent?”
Williams’s answer: “I don’t know about her, and if you could do me a favor, you don’t have to tell me about her. Thank you.”
For the record, Williams (spoiler alert) plays Anna-Lena Friedsam of Germany.

Williams suffers another setback
(AP) / 27 May 2015
Americans fifth first round defeat in last 13 Grand Slams
Paris — A loss by Venus Williams in the first round at a Grand Slam is no longer the rarity it once was.
And, as it happens, the woman who beat Williams at the French Open on Tuesday, Sloane Stephens, is making a concerted effort, at her coach’s behest, to focus less on who is on the other side of the net. Still, it was hard not to see the 22-year-old Stephens’ 7-6 (5), 6-1 dismissal of seven-time major champion Williams, who at 34 was the oldest woman in the field, as a statement about the directions their respective careers are heading.
For the 15th-seeded Williams, it was her second opening defeat in three years at Roland Garros.
It also was the fifth time in the last 13 Grand Slam tournaments she’s entered that she exited in the first round. Before that stretch, it happened once in 37 majors.
Williams didn’t show up for a news conference, meaning she could face a fine. Instead, she issued a five-sentence statement that read in part: “When you arrive at any tournament, you hope you will have a chance to work your way into the event, but I didn’t have that opportunity — she just played better than me today.”
That is true. The 40th-ranked Stephens, who has reached the French Open’s fourth round the last three years, was consistently strong from the baseline, making only 14 unforced errors to Williams’ 30.
“I want her to play with a sense of joy ... and play everything as well as she can, relentlessly, and not be concerned with the result. Let the result take care of itself. And she did a good job of that today,” said Stephens’ coach, Nick Saviano.
“I have noticed that missing. ... For any athlete, in any sport, at any high level, they must have that passion and the joy to perform,” Saviano explained. “Otherwise, it becomes onerous. It becomes too much of a job, so to speak.”
The biggest victory of Stephens’ career came at the 2013 Australian Open, when she defeated Williams’ younger sister Serena en route to the semifinals. This was the first time Stephens had faced Venus Williams, other than beating her in an exhibition as a teen.
“But,” Stephens said, “I don’t think that really counts.”
Now Stephens joins Lindsay Davenport as the only Americans to have beaten each Williams at a Grand Slam tournament.
Two other seeded women lost Monday: No. 14 Agnieszka Radwanska, who was the runner-up at Wimbledon in 2012, and No. 22 Barbora Strycova. Two seeded men exited, too, including No. 11 Feliciano Lopez, who now has 10 first-round exits in 15 appearances in Paris.
Winners included No. 3 Andy Murray, who played with his wedding ring tied to his shoe and improved to 11-0 since getting married, and defending women’s champion Maria Sharapova.
Stephens was reserved during her on-court interview, referring to Williams as “someone we all looked up to for so long,” but hardly celebrating as if this meant a lot to her. I think she’s pleased. But she wants to perform well every day. She doesn’t want to make a big deal out of one match,” Saviano said. “And she shouldn’t.”
Stephens — whose late father, John Stephens, was the 1988 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year with the New England Patriots, and whose mother, Sybil Smith, was Boston University’s first All-American in women’s swimming — was composed throughout the match, finding the spots for her deep groundstrokes.
OK, truth be told, she did lose her composure once.
Holding a break point in the second set’s second game, Stephens was preparing to receive a serve when the ball hit by Williams startled a pigeon, which flapped its wings and took off. Stephens, in turn, was startled and released quite a shriek. Instead of an ace, the point was replayed, and Williams flubbed a shot to get broken.
