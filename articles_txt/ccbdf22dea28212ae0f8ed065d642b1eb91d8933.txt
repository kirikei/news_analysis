Trenton, New Jersey (My9NJ) -
A young Philadelphia mother who faced years in prison in New Jersey for a legal gun has been pardoned.
Governor Chris Christie exercised his executive powers and granted a full pardon to Shaneen Allen.
Allen, mother of two boys, had a concealed firearm carry permit from Philadelphia. She crossed the Delaware River into New Jersey with a .38 caliber handgun in her glove compartment.
Allen said that she didn't know her permit didn't apply to New Jersey so when she was stopped for a minor traffic offense she told the police about her gun and her permit to carry.
She was arrested on the spot and could have faced up to 11 years in prison on felony charges. It's a story that Chasing News first covered in July of 2014.
Guns rights groups like the #NJ2AS and others from around the country took up her case.
She said she bought the gun to protect herself after being robbed on numerous occasions.
The prosecutors had offered a plea deal which would have included a 5-year sentence but eventually, she got into a pre-trial intervention program.
Evan Nappen has been Allen's attorney throughout the case.
“Not only what we did, but what thousands of other New Jersey citizens and the publicity from the media highlighting it was wonderful and it created positive change. It's the cherry on-top of getting her finally pardoned,” Nappen said.
Allen is thankful for everything the media did to keep her story alive.
Now, all Shaneen Allen wants to do is to get back to work.
The terms of Allen's pre-trial intervention required her to forfeit her gun and permit to carry in Philadelphia, but it was unclear if the pardon allows her to regain those rights.

Mike Cuzzo goes the extra mile. He'd give the tuxedo off his back -- he always seems to be wearing one -- in the spirit of service that he brought to his job pumping gas at the Route 9 Wawa in Howell.
