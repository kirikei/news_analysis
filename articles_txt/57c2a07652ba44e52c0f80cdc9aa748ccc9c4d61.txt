BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter will wait until Monday to announce his decision on whether he has signed legislation seeking to repeal lucrative slot-like machines in Idaho.
Otter's spokesman Jon Hanian said Friday the governor's deadline is Saturday to sign, veto or permit the law —which would repeal roughly 250 instant horse racing machines in Idaho— to pass without signing it. However, Otter will not publicly disclose his decision over the weekend.
The Idaho Legislature took Friday off and will not return until Monday afternoon. Doing so, Hanian says, will allow Otter to speak to lawmakers before announcing his decision.
SB 1011 passed both chambers with more than two-thirds support. That means, lawmakers have the option to override Otter if he vetoes the bill.
