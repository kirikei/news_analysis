WASHINGTON (AP) — An invitation to a White House state dinner has always been one of the most sought-after tickets in Washington. There's the exclusive venue, the highbrow company and a four-course meal served by America's most famous kitchen.

Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry S. Truman, who left office 62 years ago. In his first six years, Obama held just seven state dinners. He’ll hold at least two more this year, for the leaders of Japan, on April 28, 2015 and China, later in the year. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)
But it's become harder to land on the guest list. President Barack Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry S. Truman held office in the mid-1940s.
Obama has held seven dinners and plans two more this year: April 28 for Japan's leader and later on for China's president.
Truman held six dinners during nearly eight years in office.
Obama's aides say his overall level of engagement with foreign counterparts and the many ways he interacts with them is more important than the number of state dinners on his calendar.
