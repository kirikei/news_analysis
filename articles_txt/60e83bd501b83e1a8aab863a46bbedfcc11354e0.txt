Hillary Rodham Clinton entered the presidential race Sunday to a stunning cold shoulder from Mayor de Blasio and few signs of genuine enthusiasm from other top New York Democrats, who want to see her espouse a far more liberal agenda.
The lack of enthusiasm for Clinton — made clear to the nation Sunday by de Blasio’s refusal to endorse on “Meet the Press” — ranges from far-leftist “progressives” allied with de Blasio, who prefer a Wall-Street-bashing populist like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, to Jewish voters worried by President Obama’s Mideast policies, to union activists taking their lead from AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who want Clinton to face a primary challenge to force her into stronger stands on issues vital to organized labor.
And the lack of passion for Clinton was also seen on the local level Saturday at the Ready For Hillary gathering in Manhattan, where a mere 200 people and virtually no “A-list” Democratic officials attended a final fund-raiser before Clinton’s announcement.
“Democratic activists here really want progressives like de Blasio, Melissa Mark-Viverito, people like Elizabeth Warren, not someone as close to Wall Street and the big-money people as Hillary,” said a prominent Democratic consultant.
Many Democrats also describe Gov. Cuomo, who was once seen as a potential Clinton alternative for president, as surprisingly unenthusiastic about Hillary’s campaign.
“He seems distant and detached from Hillary’s effort, perhaps because it’s not his,’’ said a senior Democratic Party leader.
While Jews have always been a bedrock of Democratic support, a surprising and little-noticed Siena College poll found that while Clinton, a former US senator from this state, was viewed favorably by an overwhelming number of New York voters, 59-38 percent, she had a negative, 44-50 percent, rating among Jewish voters.
That’s a figure that’s not been lost on such powerful New York Democrats as US Sen. Chuck Schumer, insiders agree.
A prominent union insider told The Post, “Hillary isn’t close to sealing the deal with labor. Many union leaders are afraid that without a primary Hillary won’t have to address labor’s concerns before she is nominated.
“And some of the unions are also hoping for an undefined alternative while others prefer Elizabeth Warren’s economic approach,’’ he continued.
Some of the lack of energy for Clinton comes from the fear that there will be more damaging disclosures in coming months related to the e-mail scandal involving the then-secretary of state’s use of a private e-mail address and the now-erased e-mail server for official business.
“We all know there is another shoe to drop and it’s only going to get worse,’’ said a second well-known Democratic consultant. “Wiping her email server when there were outstanding [congressional] subpoenas raises very serious questions about obstruction of justice.”
But notwithstanding the problems with Empire State Democrats, Clinton, if she is the Democratic nominee, will easily carry heavily Democratic New York, even Republican leaders concede.
