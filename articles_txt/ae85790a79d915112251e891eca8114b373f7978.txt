In an effort to enhance local restaurant discovery and to display comprehensive reviews to foodies, Facebook is testing a feature that will display reviews by professional restaurant critics on respective restaurant Facebook Pages.
In order to accomplish that, Facebook has partnered with five established publications to source these professional reviews, including Bon Appetit , Conde Nast Traveler , Eater, New York magazine, and the San Francisco Chronicle. Now, when people look for certain U.S. restaurants on Facebook, critics’ reviews will show up along with starred reviews from friends and other Facebook users.
A Facebook spokesperson said-
Since reviews are such an important part of helping people make informed decisions about what to do locally, we’re excited to be incorporating a new way for people to use Facebook to find the best real-world experiences.
Unlike with user-generated reviews on Facebook, restaurant owners will not be able to flag reviews. Facebook says it picked appropriate publishing partners and will result to an accurate review for the restaurant. Facebook also plans to expand this initiative to thousands of other restaurants in coming days.
Earlier, Facebook started testing another editorial-driven mobile content feature called “ Instant Articles “, which allow users to have a faster reading experience when going through important news stories of the day on their newsfeed. Instant Articles and now critics reviews, all indicate towards how Facebook plans to become much alike a local search engine and keep users engaged on Facebook itself.
