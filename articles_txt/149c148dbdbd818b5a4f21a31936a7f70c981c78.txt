Bad at presidential elections, good at NCAA tournament predictions: Mitt Romney’s bracket is in the 99.98th percentile in ESPN.com’s "Tournament Challenge."
Mitt Romney may be bad at running for President, but he’s apparently amazing at picking his NCAA bracket.
The failed 2008 and 2012 Republican presidential candidate picked Wisconsin and Duke to make it to the NCAA men’s basketball championship game in his ESPN.com “Tournament Challenge” bracket .
He also correctly picked all four of the teams that advanced to the tournament’s “Final Four” round, as well as six of the eight teams that advanced to the tournament’s “Elite Eight” round.
Romney’s picks, provided first to The Huffington Post, were good enough, as of Monday morning, to put the former Massachusetts governor’s bracket in the 99.98th percentile of all 11.57 million brackets in the ESPN competition.
Romney has picked Duke to beat Wisconsin in Monday night’s championship game. He will be in attendance at the game.
By contrast, President Obama, who famously announces his bracket each year in a televised “Barack-etology” special on ESPN , is only in the 40th percentile in ESPN’s challenge, having picked Kentucky, which lost to Wisconsin Saturday night, to win it all.
