Hillary Clinton's official campaign announcement is expected Sunday, a source close to Clinton told the Daily News.
The former secretary of state is likely to announce via video and social media as she kicks off her long-expected second shot at the White House.
She's expected to begin her campaign with a series of smaller events in early-voting states including Iowa and New Hampshire, though it remains to be seen how low key the high-profile candidate will be able to keep her trip.

It has been known for close to a month that Clinton was aiming for an April announcement, and her campaign's move towards renting office space in Brooklyn last week confirmed that timeline.
Clinton appears to have an easy path to the Democratic nomination - her poll numbers among Democrats have remained strong for months and no serious challengers appear likely to take her on in the primary.
She's also led most of her GOP foes in national and state-level polling for much of the past year, though those numbers may be taking a bit of a hit - new polling from Quinnipiac University Thursday shows her slipping a bit in the swing states of Iowa, Colorado and Virginia.
