FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — A former Republican state representative has pleaded guilty to attempting to accept illegal campaign contributions.
Forrest "Ben" Waide's 12-month jail sentence was suspended to two years of probation. He pleaded guilty Friday morning in Franklin County Circuit Court.
It's against the law for Kentucky politicians to accept campaign contributions from corporations. Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway said Waide accepted contributions from Liberty Rehabilitation PSC, where Waide was a partner. The company's shareholders filed a complaint in 2010 that prompted the investigation.
Conway said Waide will pay the company back more than $15,000.
Waide represented Madisonville in the state House of Representatives from 2010 to 2014. He did not run for re-election. Instead, he ran for Hopkins County judge-executive. He lost by about 2,200 votes.
