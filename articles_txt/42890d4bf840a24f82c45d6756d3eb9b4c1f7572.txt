Monthly bill Maher slammed fundamentalists for their anti-homosexual views and adherence to Scripture on Friday evening.
Through "Genuine Time With Monthly bill Maher," the host talked over how discrimination towards gay persons by Christian fundamentalists is rooted in the latter's literal belief in the Bible.
"The purpose fundamentalists are so stubbornly anti-gay is they really imagine that condoning homosexuality will bring on God's wrath," he stated. "Consider fundamentalists at their word. They actually believe that this stuff."
As evidence, Maher pointed to responses made by this sort of popular fundamentalists as Jerry Falwell, John Hagee, Pat Robertson and Bob Jones III about how gay men and women need to be mistreated and how God has allegedly expressed his anger in excess of Pleasure parades.
