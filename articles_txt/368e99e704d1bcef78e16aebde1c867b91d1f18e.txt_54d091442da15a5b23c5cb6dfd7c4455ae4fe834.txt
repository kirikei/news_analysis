CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - Gov. Brian Sandoval has approved a bill extending Nevada’s statute of limitations on sexual assault cases so victims have more time to report their experience and pursue criminal charges.
Sandoval signed AB212 on Tuesday surrounded by lawmakers and supporters. The bill raises the reporting deadline on sex assaults from four years to 20 years after the date of the alleged crime.
A Nevada woman who accused comedian Bill Cosby of sexually assaulted her decades ago testified in support of the bill in March.
Proponents of the bill said it would help sexual assault victims who sometimes take years to gather the courage to file a police report.
The bill unanimously passed both the Assembly and Senate.

Question of the Day

CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Nevada Assembly members are vetting a plan worth about $600 million that would permanently extend some temporary taxes and raise the cigarette tax.
The Assembly Taxation Committee held a hearing Tuesday on SB483.
The bill would make temporary rates on the payroll tax and sales tax permanent. It also raises taxes on cigarettes from 80 cents to $1.80 per pack.
The so-called "sunset taxes" were created in 2009 and lawmakers have temporarily extended them every two years. Gov. Brian Sandoval called on lawmakers to make the taxes a permanent part of the state's budget after years of relying on them to fund the budget.
