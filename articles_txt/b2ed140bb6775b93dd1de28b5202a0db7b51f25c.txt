Obama in Utah
President Barack Obama speaks Friday morning about creating solar energy jobs at Hill Air Force Base.
Posted: Friday, April 3, 2015 9:49 pm
HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah — President Barack Obama stopped in Salt Lake City to discuss solar industry training for military veterans on Friday. 
After spending the night in the city and talking to Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints leaders on Thursday, Obama appeared at Hill Air Force Base near Ogden to announce new steps to support military veterans by training them for solar industry jobs. 
“A lot of our men and women in uniform at some point are going to transition into civilian life, and we want to make sure that after they’ve fought for our freedom that they’ve got jobs to come home to,” the president said.
The departments of Energy and Defense are starting a program at 10 military bases nationwide, including at Hill Air Force Base, to teach service members who are transitioning out of the military how to install solar panels.
“We’ve got to be relentless in our work to grow the economy and create new jobs,” Obama said. “We’ve got to lead by example, invest in the future and train our workers to get jobs in the clean energy economy.”
According to the International Business Times, “Under the new Solar Ready Vets program, the departments of Energy and Defense will launch solar training programs at 10 military bases across the country, including at the Hill Air Force base. Pilot programs are already underway at Camp Pendleton in California, Fort Carson in Colorado and Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. To help veterans pay for solar training off-base, the Department of Veterans Affairs will work to expand its GI Bill program to include training courses at community colleges.”
The Energy Department has committed to training 75,000 people, including veterans, for solar industry jobs by 2020.
Utah was the 49th state visited by Obama and the latest stop on his recent tour of Republican “red” states. South Dakota now has the distinction of being the only state awaiting a presidential visit by Obama. With 21 months left on his term, he has plenty of time to get there.
In terms of travel, Obama had visited 46 states by the start of the year. The White House quickly scheduled presidential appearances in Idaho and South Carolina — two of the four remaining states — followed by Utah.
Since Republicans took control of both houses of Congress in January, Obama has traveled to 10 GOP states: Arizona, Tennessee, Idaho, Kansas, Indiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky and Utah, all of which voted for Obama rival Mitt Romney in 2012. Obama also has visited nine states that voted for his re-election.
The White House says there is no concerted effort to put the president in Republican states. “There are really important, substantive reasons that explain the places we go,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.
When he gets to South Dakota, Obama will become the fourth president to hit all 50 states, according to the White House Historical Association.
Richard Nixon was first, followed by George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Ronald Reagan came four states short of the goal. George W. Bush never made it to Vermont.
