Merriam-Webster adds 'clickbait,' 'macaron' and about 1,700 other new entries to its online dictionary
Just what you were looking for: a story about the arrival of clickbait
“Clickbait” has arrived -- in Merriam-Webster’s unabridged online dictionary.
The first known use of “clickbait” was in 2010, the dictionary says, and the word means “something (such as a headline) designed to make readers want to click on a hyperlink especially when the link leads to content of dubious value or interest.”
Is this post feeling a little too self-referential? Awkward. Let’s move on.
Several of Merriam-Webster’s newly added terms are themselves ripped from the headlines.
“Colony collapse disorder,” for example, refers to a problem plaguing honeybees , which in turn is threatening U.S. agriculture.
“Dark money” refers to money for political campaigns donated through nonprofits that can keep donors’ identities secret .
The “sharing economy” involves individual people buying and selling access to goods and services such as cars and places to stay. It’s usually done online; for example, through Lyft, Uber, ZipCar and Airbnb.
Other newly added terms are somewhat obscure. “Hsaing-waing” is “a traditional Burmese musical ensemble consisting largely of drums and gongs.”
And some additions are delicious, such as the Mexican “chilaquiles” and the sandwich cookie “macaron.”
