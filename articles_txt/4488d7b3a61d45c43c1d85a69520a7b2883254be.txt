ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — A measure to make it easier for transgender residents to get new birth certificates has cleared the Maryland General Assembly .
The Maryland House of Delegates passed a Senate bill Wednesday on a 91-49 vote. That sends the bill to Gov. Larry Hogan .
The measure allows transgender residents to get new birth certificate, and it does not require them to have undergone surgery. The bill also requires the new birth certificate not to be marked as a change in a person's gender, as they are now.
Supporters of the bill say taking away the requirement that the birth certificate was amended will help ease concerns about discrimination when transgender residents apply for jobs.
