Miley Cyrus will not stand for this kind of discrimination!
Our outspoken rebel isn't holding back when it comes to all these "religious freedom" bills that are getting signed.
He spoke out in a CNN interview, saying:
"I think it's important we have a sense of perspective. In Iran they hang you for the crime of being gay."
So you know that didn't sit well with Miles. She took to Twitter to call on her followers to be heard:
Senator Cotton thinks gay community needs to get "perspective" cuz "In Iran they hang you for the crime of being gay."
Let's stir some shit up! Senator Cotton (202) 224-2353 !!!! Happy Hippies call & express why freedom is important to us & our country!
And stir it up they did, because we hear the Senator's voicemail box filled up awfully quickly!
We definitely think Mr. Cotton is speaking some crazy talk, and we hope it doesn't continue because everyone deserves to have the same rights no matter if they love men or women.
