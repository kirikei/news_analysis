A friend says this of Dellavedova: "It's like Tonya Harding grew a beard, put on 80 pounds & got an NBA contract" pic.twitter.com/pJWfsZJM01
Matthew Dellavedova isn’t going to be getting any new fans in the Atlanta area. He has emerged as public enemy number one during the Hawks series against the Cavaliers.
With the Hawks on the brink of elimination, even the radio broadcasters have had enough of Dellavedova’s antics. When he checked in Tuesday night during Game 4 the radio broadcaster Steve Holman called him “Tonya Harding.”
Dellavedova checks into the game for Kyrie Irving. Hawks radio broadcast says "Tonya Harding" checking in.
Did @RealVoiceofHawk call Delly "Tonya Harding"? If so, the legend continues. Love that man.
Steve Holman calling Dellavadova "Tonya Harding" makes the season.  Lol.
psst the Atlanta Hawks broadcast guy who called Delly "Tonya Harding" is @RealVoiceofHawk . I know you guys won't be mean spirited to him…
The Hawks season looks like it will end Tuesday night as the Cavaliers are blowing out the Hawks. However, it doesn’t look like the feelings of Hawks fans towards Dellavedova will improve any time soon.
Although, it seems like Dellavedova is clearly a big believer in the “sticks and stones” mentality. If anything this will just get him going a little more.
