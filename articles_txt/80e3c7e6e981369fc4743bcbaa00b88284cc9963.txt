Gov. Pat McCrory, seen here at a bill signing last week, is wagering North Carolina barbecue and other local treats in Monday's men's national basketball championship between Duke and Wisconsin.
The bets are in, but Gov. Scott Walker is not upping the ante.
On Friday, the Republican governor bet Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat, an assortment of Wisconsin cheese, sausage and root beer that the Wisconsin Badgers would beat the Kentucky Wildcats.
That prize went unclaimed, so Walker is now offering the same wager to North Carolina's Republican governor, Pat McCrory, ahead of Monday night's battle for the national NCAA men's basketball championship between the Duke Blue Devils and the Wisconsin Badgers.
McCrory is wagering some North Carolina barbecue, coleslaw, hush puppies and Cheerwine if the Duke Blue Devils beat the Badgers. Duke has won four national titles; the Badgers' only championship was 74 years ago, in 1941.
Barbecue, coleslaw and even hush puppies can be found around these parts. But what's Cheerwine?
According to Cheerwine.com , it's a "singular soft drink with a hint of wild cherry and a bubbly effervescence."
Probably goes well with a slice of humble pie.
