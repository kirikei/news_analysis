SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Former U.S. Rep. Judy Biggert has been appointed to a $94,000-a-year position on the state board that oversees collective bargaining involving public schools and state universities.
Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner 's administration announced the appointment Friday. Biggert's term on the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board will run until 2020 if she's confirmed by the Illinois Senate .
Biggert represented Illinois' 13th Congressional District from 1999 to 2013. She lost to Democrat Bill Foster in 2012 for a chance to represent the 11th Congressional District, which was created when new districts were drawn after the 2010 Census.
The new map put the Republican's Hinsdale home in a new, heavily Democratic area.
Biggert had previously served three terms in the Illinois House .
The position on the state board comes with a $93,926 annual salary.
