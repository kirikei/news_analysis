South Carolina lawmakers are getting a vacation this week.
Neither the House nor Senate will be in session as the Legislature takes a week off for spring break. The House also wasn't in session last week, while the Senate met for two days.
The spring break for both chambers is a recent development. The House has traditionally taken off for a week around Easter, but the Senate just started taking its own week off in 2013.
Lawmakers will still face plenty of issues when they return on April 14 such as ethics reform, tougher domestic violence laws and getting more money to fix South Carolina roads.
