A day after Leeâs Sandwiches recalled roughly 100 tons of meat products, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the Garden Grove processing plant that distributes the chainâs food in multiple states would be further investigated for misbranding violations that reach back at least a year.
âOur inspectors will dive more into their process,â the USDA said Tuesday.
On Monday, Leeâs Sandwiches confirmed the voluntary recall, which has targeted 213,000 pounds of meat processed at LQNN from May 18, 2014 to May 18.
The sandwich chain, founded by the Le family, originally started as a food service company in the Bay Area in the 1980s. Years later, the family launched a chain of sandwich shops known for their inexpensive Vietnamese-style sandwiches. A signature baguette sandwich could contain ingredients such as cold slices of headcheese, jambon (salted ham), pate, julienne carrots, onions, mayonnaise and cilantro.
More than 50 Leeâs restaurants operate in California â including two Inland locations, one in Riverside and another in Chino â Arizona, Oregon, Nevada, Oklahoma and Texas.
In a prepared statement, Leeâs chief operations officer, Tom Quach, apologized and assured the public the mislabeled products were safe.
âWe also would like to assure the public that the implicated products were produced in an FDA regulated facility and that the leadership of LQNN is confident that the products being recalled all meet the food safety standards of the company and were manufactured using ingredients and processes that meet the requirements of the FDA,â Quach said in a statement on the companyâs website.
Here are a few answers to some other questions about the recall, provided by USDA.
Q. What exactly happened?
A. During a routine inspection May 19, USDA officers visiting the central kitchen of LQNN, at 7180 Lampson Ave., discovered the plant had been modifying USDA-certified meats by further processing them within the plant. The final product was then erroneously given a USDA certification, and shipped to restaurants.
Q. What does âfurther processingâ mean?
A. It means the plant was either cooking the USDA-certified meats or blending them with another product to create a new food item. Any such âprocessingâ is subject to USDA inspection, the agency said. âCooking needs to be regulated by us,â the USDA told the Register.
Q. What foods were recalled?
A. The biggest quantities of recalled meat products were âpork pate chaudâ (61,000 pounds), âchicken pate chaudâ (56,000 pounds), âbanh bao pork and egg steamed bunâ (55,000 pounds), âsliced oil browned turkeyâ (23,000 pounds) and âbanh boa trung cut pork and quail egg steamed bunâ (15,000 pounds).
