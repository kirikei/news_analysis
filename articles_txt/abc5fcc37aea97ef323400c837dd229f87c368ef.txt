Workers at Chinese online game developer NetDragon will be hoping that an office building shaped like Star Trek spaceship USS Enterprise will help them live long and prosper.
Brush off the Star Trek quotes because a Chinese businessman has boldly gone where no man has gone before, building something that is an office but not as we know it.
That's because Hong Kong-listed Chinese online game developer NetDragon Websoft has constructed a six-storey building resembling the starship USS Enterprise.
The 100-metre wide by 260m long building in the coastal city of Changle in China's southeast Fujian province cost 600 million yuan ($133.6 million), The Wall Street Journal reported.
Google Maps provides a good view of the structure . Apparently Trekkies have been heatedly debating online which of the spaceships called Enterprise in Star Trek TV programmes and films the building is based on.
Turns out it's NCC-1701-E, which appeared in three movies in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
NetDragon founder Liu Dejian, 43, who went to the University of Kansas, was a huge fan of Star Trek, the Journal said. He was also a board member of Chinese search engine giant Baidu.
NetDragon had contacted US media company CBS, which produces Star Trek, to get permission for the Enterprise-shaped architecture.
"That was their first time dealing with issue like this and at first they thought that it was a joke," NetDragon said in an email.
The exterior is not the only interesting aspect of the building. Inside it has a life-sized Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton replica, modelled after one found in South Dakota in 1987.
Construction started in late 2010 and finished in May 2014.
