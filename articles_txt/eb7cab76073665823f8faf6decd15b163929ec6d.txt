Lee's Sandwiches is the supplier of meat products in Arizona, California, Oklahoma, Oregon and Texas. However, there were no reports of hospitalizations and illness associated with eating the meat during the time they were produced.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced that they are conducting a probe on the alleged unauthorized use of USDA mark of inspection by the company. They used the mark of inspection of another company identified as Establishment number 18995, LA Times reports.
This was discovered by FSIS personnel during a surveillance review, said Congressional and Public Affairs Officer of the USDA, Gabrielle N. Johnston, in a press release . The personnel observed the products which were not inspected by the government agency.
Since there were still no complaints or reports of adverse reactions from the consumption of the products, they are recommending to those consumers who experienced unwanted effects of the products to immediately report it to their health care providers and the USDA.
In 2013, around 740 pounds of Lee's Sandwiches sausages were also recalled after USDA officers found these sausages contain toxins that may lead to food poisoning.
