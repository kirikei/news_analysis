You know all those GoPro videos you see on the Internet? You know the ones. Where crazy people skydive off planes and fly in wingsuits and snowboard and ride motorcycles and jump off cliffs and live Very Extreme Lives. All of that happens in the trailer for the remake of Point Break. Only they slapped a dark and gritty filter to make it “cinematic”.
The trailer for the remake is nice to look at (I mean, the stunts are cool?) but it doesn’t look like it’ll capture the magic of the original. Plus, these guys aren’t Swayze (RIP) or Keanu.
Hollywood has run out of ideas.
