A volcano perched atop one of Ecuador's Galapagos Islands erupted in the early hours of Monday, the local authorities said, potentially threatening a unique species of pink iguanas. The roughly 1.7-kilometer (1.1-mile) high Wolf volcano is located on Isabela Island, home to a rich variety of flora and fauna typical of the archipelago that helped inspire Charles Darwin's theory of evolution following his 1835 visit.

A volcano in the Galapagos Islands has erupted for the first time in more than 30 years, raising fears for the world's only colony of pink iguanas.
The Galapagos National Park warned on Twitter that Isabela Island, where Wolf Volcano erupted at dawn, holds "the world's only population" of the critically-endangered Conolophus marthae, also known as the Galapagos rosy iguana.
But the park later said the iguanas' habitat on the volcano's northwest side appeared to be out of danger. The iguanas, "which share the habitat with yellow iguanas and giant Chelonoidis becki tortoises, are situated on the northwest flank, which raises hopes that they will not be affected," it said in a statement.
The fiery streams of lava that trickled down the volcano on Monday morning were on the opposite side, officials said. Pictures show bright lava streaming down the volcano as a puff of smoke rises into the air and tongues of fire dart from the crater.
