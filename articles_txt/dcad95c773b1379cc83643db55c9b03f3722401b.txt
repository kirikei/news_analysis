2015-04-09T07:00:00Z Gazette opinion: Montana House blasts past schemes to block health care debate The Billings Gazette

Instead, Wittich said, the committee would vote on the bill immediately.
Democratic members protested that they hadn’t had time to review written testimony submitted the public during the 4 1/2-hour hearing that just ended. With dozens of proponents lined up to testify, Wittich repeatedly told them to state only their name and where they are from to speed up the hearing. So they handed in written pleas for health coverage.
Among those speakers supporting SB405 were leaders of the Montana League of Cities and Towns, Montana Association of Counties, Montana’s Catholic hospitals, Billings Clinic, Benefis Health, Kalispell Regional Healthcare, Montana Medical Association, Montana Chamber of Commerce, Montana AFL-CIO, Big Sky Economic Development Authority, AARP Montana, Montana Food Bank Network, National Alliance on Mental Illness, Montana Dental Association, Western Native Voice and MHA, which represents Montana community hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies.
People grateful for their health insurance asked the committee to give that peace of mind to low-income Montanans. Folks who don’t have and can’t afford health insurance asked the committee to help them by passing SB405.
Poison amendments
Their pleas didn’t change Wittich’s strategy. He already had three amendments written and ready to subvert the SB405 compromise
In short order, the committee’s GOP majority amended the bill by:
- Deleting the entire bill, except for the title, and substituting House Bill 249, Gov. Steve Bullock’s Medicaid expansion bill, which the same lawmakers killed several weeks ago.
- Adding a pointless requirement for hospitals to provide the state with various reports on their uncompensated care – information that is already available to the public. A similar proposal had already died in another committee.
- Turning SB405 into a referendum, knowing full well that Medicaid expansion cannot be decided at the ballot box. Only the Legislature can authorize the state to accept and spend the federal funding. A referendum, at best, would cause a replay of this health care fight in 2017.
Democrats were justifiably upset. Rep. Ellie Boldman Hill, of Missoula, said she was “beyond shocked” by the “dirty dealing.”
‘People are dying’
“You’re kicking the can down the road,” said Carolyn Pease-Lopez of Billings. “In the meantime, people are dying.”
“Without the amendment, it will gain bipartisan support,” said Rep. Jessica Karjala of Billings.
The committee’s final vote Tuesday on SB405 completed the twisted treatment by requiring those in favor to vote “no” and those opposed to vote “yes.”
Thursday debate set
The battle continued an hour later on the House floor where House Minority Leader Chuck Hunter of Helena objected that the committee action violated the House “silver bullet” rule, which allows each party to bring six bills of its choosing to the House floor for a majority decision. House Speaker Austin Knudsen of Culbertson ruled Hunter out of order, and the rules fight went on Wednesday with a 52-48 vote to debate the bill Thursday on the House floor.
SB405 is the biggest economic development opportunity these lawmakers have seen. It would make all very low income Montanans eligible for health coverage in a state where most low income adults haven’t been eligible for Medicaid. SB405 would be a godsend for the hospitals, doctors and clinics that do the most to care for indigent, uninsured and underinsured Montanans.
Thanks to the lawmakers who voted to debate SB405: Democrats and 11 Republicans, including Geraldine Custer of Forsyth, Tom Berry of Roundup and Tom Richmond of Billings.

I'm grateful for the few Republicans who have a conscience, and the common sense and wisdom to do what's right for Montana.  Unfortunately, there aren't many of them left.

I agree with the previous comment. Wittich may not have much integrity but he convinced people to put him in the legislature.

We can't complain about Wittich, et al.  He may have no integrity, and he may be a malignant schemer, but he wouldn't be there if his district hadn't voted him in.  The infuriating thing about that is that so many reasonable people don't vote.  His district might still have sent him to Helena (which is a statement about them, not him) , but had the dems turned out across the state, his party wouldn't be in the majority, and he wouldn't have chaired his committee.
