The Israeli Air Force attacked four targets in the Gaza Strip early Wednesday morning, following an earlier rocket attack on Israeli territory, the IDF spokesperson said.
The IDF identified the targets, in the southern part of the coastal enclave, as terror infrastructure.
The army added that it viewed the Tuesday rocket attack on Israel with severity and it holds Hamas responsible.
A rocket from Gaza exploded in the Gan Yavne region, east of Ashdod on Tuesday  evening, shattering four weeks of quiet and setting of air raid sirens in the  Ashdod and Lakhish regions.
Apart from a 15-year-old girl who was taken to Barzilai Medical Center in Ashdod  suffering from a panic attack,  the rocket failed to cause injuries, though  emergency responders were  still assessing on Tuesday whether the projectile had  caused any  damages. 
Tuesday's rocket was the first mid-range rocket attack  since the ceasefire went into effect on August 26 following the month  and a half long war with Gaza known as Operation Protective Edge.
There  was no  immediate indication about which terrorist group fired the  rocket.
