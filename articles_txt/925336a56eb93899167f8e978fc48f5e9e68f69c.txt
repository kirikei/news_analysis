Robert Rodriguez has reportedly signed up to direct Jonny Quest.
A movie adaptation of the classic cartoon has long been in the works. But after several years of little happening on the project, it has now been claimed Sin City director Robert is in line to helm the upcoming film.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Robert is also rewriting the script originally penned by Dan Mazeau. He will be aided in the rewrite by Terry Rossio.
The outlet also reports that Dan Lin and Adrian Askarieh have agreed to produce the movie for Warner Bros.
Jonny Quest was a Hanna-Barbera cartoon which told the story of a young boy who accompanied his father on a series of extraordinary adventures.
Originally running from 1964 to 1965, it was brought back for 13 episodes in 1986. It was once again revisited in the 1990s, and ran on Cartoon Network until 2002.
Talk began of a live action movie of Jonny's tale in 1995 but production never officially began.
Then, in 2009, it was claimed that Zac Efron and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson had been cast to star in the film.
Dwayne, who can currently be seen in disaster picture San Andreas, said at the time he was thrilled to have been given a chance to read for the role of Race Bannon in Jonny Quest.
"I don't know if you've read the latest draft but it's awesome and it's bada**," he told Moviehole. "I hadn't read an action script like that in a LONG time. And that action was unbelievable. That will happen."
