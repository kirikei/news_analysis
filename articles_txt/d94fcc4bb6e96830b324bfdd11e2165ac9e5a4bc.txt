As defined by Merriam-Webster , emoji is "any of various small images, symbols, or icons in text fields in electronic communication to express the emotional attitude of the writer, convey information succinctly, communicate a message playfully without using words, etc."
The term emoji is borrowed from Japanese, in which the word literally means pictograph. It is a combination of e, which means picture, and moji, which means letter or character. Recently, the Unicode Consortium has released 38 proposed new emoji for 2016. In April, Apple released numerous new emoji in iOS 8.3, Refinery29 reported.   
Two of the 23 new official words are about linguistics, which are vocal fry and eggcorn, four are about food, which are crema, lambrusco, chilaquiles and macaron, two are about music, which are hsaing-waing and slendro, and one is about clothing, which is jeggings.
