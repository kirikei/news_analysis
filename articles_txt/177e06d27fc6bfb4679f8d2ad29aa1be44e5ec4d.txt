COLUMBUS, Ohio -
Customers of an international floral delivery service and a class reunion website may be entitled a share of an $11 million settlement according to Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine.
Ohio and other states reached the settlement with Classmates Inc., along with Florists' Transworld Delivery Inc., and FTD.com Inc. after investigating the companies for engaging in misleading advertising and billing practices.
The investigation focused on the companies' relationships with third-parties that used negative option marketing practices to sell membership programs to consumers doing business online with Classmates and FTD.
Negative option marketing is a sales practice in which a seller treats a consumer's failure to take an affirmative action, either to reject an offer or cancel an agreement, as consent to be charged for goods or services.
These third-party marketers, which offered programs such as discount buying clubs and travel rewards programs, were given the consumer's information immediately after the consumer's online transaction with Classmates or FTD.
The sharing, which was done without a consumer's knowledge, included credit card account so that the consumer could be billed for these offers if they did not affirmatively cancel the service.
The attorneys general also investigated Classmates' renewal and cancellation practices in connection with its own social network subscription services offered to consumers through its website, Classmates.com .
The attorneys general allege Classmates failed to adequately inform consumers that their subscriptions would automatically renew and made it difficult for consumers to cancel their subscriptions.
Under the settlement, Classmates has agreed to make significant changes to its business practices, including more clearly disclosing to consumers that their Classmates subscriptions will automatically renew and making it easier for consumers to cancel their subscriptions.
Classmates and FTD denied any wrongdoing, but in order to settle the matter they agreed to make an $8 million payment to the attorneys general. Ohio will receive $454,779.87.
Additionally, Classmates is establishing a $3 million restitution fund to provide refunds to consumers who were enrolled into Classmates' subscription service without authorization or who experienced difficulty when trying to cancel their Classmates subscriptions.
Consumers seeking a refund from Classmates, and who have not previously filed a complaint with the Ohio Attorney General, may file a complaint at www.OhioAttorneyGeneral.gov or by calling 800-282-0515 before August 24, 2015.
Consumers who previously filed complaints regarding Classmates' renewal and cancellation practices may also be eligible to receive restitution under the settlement.
