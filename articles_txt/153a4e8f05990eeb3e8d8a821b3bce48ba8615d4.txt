Authorities responded Saturday to reports of shots fired on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol Building, prompting the entire building to be placed on lockdown.
The lockdown lasted almost two hours as police investigated the shooting, which was later confirmed to be a suicide. Officials ordered the precautionary lockdown after reporting the shooter had been "neutralized" and as police checked a suspicious package connected to the shooting.

Fox News confirmed the shooter died of ‎a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The gunman killed himself just before 2 p.m.
Sources familiar with the situation told Fox News the shooter shot themselves in the head. It was unclear what weapon they used.
The bomb squad immediately checked out the suspicious package -- a rolling luggage bag -- but found nothing of interest, nor any additional weapons.
A senior law enforcement official told  Fox News the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force was on the scene providing "bomb tech" support. 
The source said there was no indication of terrorism.
The lockdown came as Washington marked the annual Cherry Blossom Festival, which attracts scores of tourists to Capitol Hill and the downtown Mall area.
Multiple law enforcement and emergency services responded quickly, including DC Metro Police Department and the DC Fire Department. 
"U.S. Capitol Police are locking down the U.S. Capitol Building and the Capitol Visitor Center due to a potential security threat," Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said. She said no one was allowed to enter or exit the two buildings.
Schneider said the lockdown was lifted around 3:45 p.m..
Congress has been on spring break for two weeks and lawmakers are set to return to work Monday.
