EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) -- Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Ann Walsh Bradley says this Tuesday's Spring Election is a watershed moment, an important election for the future of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Justice Bradley was in Eau Claire Sunday, talking about her re-election campaign just two days before the election.
She is running against Rock County Circuit Court Judge James Daley.
In the days ahead, Bradley says she will be traveling across the state, asking people to get out and vote.
Bradley says we need to keep politics out of the court because political parties have agendas.
"When people come to court, they want to make sure they get a fair shake, no matter how rich or poor, or powerful or powerless, and that's the proven record that I have had for the last twenty years, " says Bradley.
Judge Daley released a statement to WEAU saying, in part, "Wisconsin needs a justice that employs common sense and respects the rule of law, and on Tuesday April 7th together we can make that change."
