OSCEOLA COUNTY, FL (WFLA) -
A woman is behind bars in Osceola County after authorities say she threatened to kill Florida Governor Rick Scott.
Investigators say Ruba Khandaqji, 36 first made the threat on a recorded telephone line, telling authorities that she is trapped in this country and wants to be deported.
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement says she made the threat again to deputies when they showed up on her doorstep.
Khandaqji was arrested and charged with two counts of corruption by threat against a public servant and one count of resisting arrest without violence.
She is being held in the Osceola County Jail with bond set at $5,000.
Khandaqji's city of residence is not listed in jail documents.
Investigators say Khandaqji also sent an email in February that did not contain a threat, but put her on police radar.
