CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval is planning to issue an executive order to address the state's ongoing drought.
The Republican governor will announce the order on Wednesday during a press conference at Washoe Lake State Park.
Sandoval said in a statement that the order will address ongoing drought concerns and help ensure the state is prepared for future challenges. Additional details were expected during the press conference.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture in February declared most of the state as a natural disaster area due to lingering drought conditions and historically low water levels.
California Gov. Jerry Brown issued an order last week requiring a 25 percent cutback in town and city water usage.
