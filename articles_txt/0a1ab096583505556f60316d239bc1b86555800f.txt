WASHINGTON — Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is heralding a commitment from thousands of Democratic Party officials to push Hillary Rodham Clinton to adopt her populist economic policies.
In a statement, Warren says anyone who runs for president should talk about "big economic ideas." She says she welcomes those working to keep those ideas central to the conversation in 2016.
Warren's comments come a day after the Progressive Change Campaign Committee announced that 5,000 Democratic leaders had signed on to its "Ready for Boldness" campaign.
Clinton is on the brink of announcing her campaign. The effort urges her and other potential Democratic presidential candidates to run on "big, bold, economic-populist ideas."
