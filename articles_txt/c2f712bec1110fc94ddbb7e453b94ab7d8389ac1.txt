LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul's first round of campaign events are nearly over, but the Kentucky senator has generated a series of negative headlines at a critical time.
Paul launched his campaign Tuesday in Louisville with a speech that many Republican onlookers praised. Paul's speeches in early primary states have gone off without any reported gaffes, yet Paul has had confrontational interviews that the national media have widely reported.
"On the ground, things have gone very well with this launch," said Chuck Todd, host of NBC's ' Meet The Press .' "I certainly think some of the national attention that he's gotten for some of the back-and-forth in different interviews, that part of it hasn't gone so well."
Paul was in Iowa on Friday, saying that he was the Republican candidate who could excite young people to vote Republican. Paul has focused on civil liberties and foreign policy at previous stops in New Hampshire and Iowa.
Paul's first trip of his nascent campaign ends Saturday in Nevada.
Democrat Hillary Clinton is likely to join the 2016 race with an announcement on social media Sunday , while Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has an event scheduled for Monday. Paul and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas are the only two candidates officially in the race.
