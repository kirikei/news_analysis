New Jersey's highest court will hear the Christie administration's appeal in a case over funding of the state's pension system.
The New Jersey Supreme Court on Monday issued an order that set oral arguments in the case for May 6.
The order comes as Gov. Christie seeks to reverse a judge's February decision that said the governor broke the law in June when he slashed the state's payment to the pension system for public employees by $1.6 billion for the current fiscal year.
Christie said the move was necessitated by a revenue shortfall.
Mercer County Superior Court Judge Mary C. Jacobson ruled that Christie had substantially impaired public workers' contractual rights to a bigger pension payment, as codified in a 2011 law.
That law extracted concessions from public-sector unions but also required the state to phase in bigger pension payments over seven years. The contractual rights, Jacobson ruled, were protected by the U.S. and state constitutions.
Jacobson ordered Christie to work with the Democratic-controlled Legislature to find the additional $1.6 billion for the pension fund. However, both his administration and the Legislature's Democratic leadership have said that task was too onerous this late in the fiscal year, which ends June 30.
In a court filing last week, the Christie administration argued that Jacobson had "fabricated a constitutional right" to such funding.
The pension system for some 770,000 active and retired public workers has an unfunded liability of $83 billion under new accounting standards.
Christie, a Republican considering running for president in 2016, wants to overhaul the pension and health benefits systems for public employees.
