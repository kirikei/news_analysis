Revenues made available for education, workforce training, economic development and other key investments
JEFFERSON CITY – Following an increase in state revenues, $43 million is now available for priorities including education, workforce training, and economic development, Gov. Jay Nixon announced today.
“Last year Missouri added more than 44,000 jobs, and this strong economic momentum has continued into 2015,” said Gov. Nixon. “The recent uptick in revenues reflects the broad-based growth we’re seeing in our economy and allows us to make additional dollars available for education, economic development and other key priorities. Moving forward, I will continue to exercise strict fiscal discipline to balance the budget and make smart investments that will strengthen our economy and our communities.”
State Budget Director Linda Luebbering announced yesterday that 2015 fiscal year-to-date net general revenue collections increased 6.8 percent compared to 2014, from $5.57 billion last year to $5.95 billion this year.
The Governor noted that revenues remain below the levels necessary to fully fund the Fiscal Year 2015 budget passed last year by the General Assembly, which was several hundred million dollars out of balance, with appropriations greatly exceeding projected revenues.  In Missouri, governors have a responsibility to keep the budget in balance throughout the year and ensure spending does not exceed available revenues.
