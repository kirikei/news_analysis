SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Democratic legislative leaders are proposing a package of 10 bills that would extend health care, legal rights and business protections to immigrants who are illegally living in California.
Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins of San Diego and Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon of Los Angeles will lead a legislative push Tuesday to expand health coverage to all Californians, regardless of their immigration status.
A legislative source who was briefed on the proposal but not authorized to discuss it before its release says the package includes bills to help immigrants who have been the victim of a crime apply for legal status and help the recent surge of immigrant children crossing the border.
It also would bar businesses from discriminating against someone based on their immigration status.
