With Memorial Day weekend unofficially kicking off the summer, Kylie Jenner is celebrating the warmer weather by showing off some serious skin ! 
The 17-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star took to Instagram on Monday and posted a photo of herself wearing a barely there crop top and short shorts while sitting poolside, along with the caption: "Secret projects." (So mysterious!)

She also served up a little leg on rocky turf.
Meanwhile, photographer Neave Bozorgi also shared this shot of Kylie flaunting her body by the pool in her swimsuit top with jeans unbuttoned.

Last week, Kylie fought back against body shamers when she captioned an Instagram shot of herself in a swimsuit saying, "Yes, I gained weight. There, I said it so you don't have to."
