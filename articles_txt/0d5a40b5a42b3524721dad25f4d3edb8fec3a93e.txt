“These things sometimes happen, they’re inexplicable, never happened before and it just happened at an inopportune time, I regret to say,” she said.
Abraham says she’s embarrassed about the incident but assures constituents it will not affect her campaigning.
While addressing the media she joked “I fell gracefully.”
The debate continued with candidates Nelson Diaz, Jim Kenney, Doug Oliver, Milton Street and Senator Anthony Williams. The group talked about funding education and addressing high poverty rates, reports ABC 6 .
