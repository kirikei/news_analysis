Samsung Unveils Limited Edition of Galaxy S6 Edge
Samsung Electronics has unveiled the "Iron Man" edition of its Galaxy S6 Edge.
The electronics giant said Tuesday that only 1,000 units of the limited edition are available for preorder from Wednesday.
The back of the vibrant red and gold phone features the Iron Man mask and serial number.
The 64-GB smartphone comes with a price tag of around W1.2 million and is available through all three mobile carriers (US$1=W1,107).

Resplendent in red and gold, this is Samsung’s attempt to bring together its Marvel tie-ins with its latest slightly weird S6 Edge handset. The result is… probably not the phone Tony Stark would choose?
The fully Iron Man-themed package includes an arc reactor-esque wireless charger, which you can see in the video below, along with a clear cover to protect the 64GB version of the S6 Edge. But cosmetic tweaks aside — including that big old Iron Man face on the back — there’s little to differentiate it from the standard version of the phone. So you can breathe a sigh of relief when you find out that, for now at least, the phone will only be available in South Korea, China and Hong Kong. Bad luck, Marvel fans. [ Engadget ]
