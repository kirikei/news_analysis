Auburn University officials announced Friday there has been a data security lapse that has affected about 370,000 current, former and future students.
Officials say personal information was available online from September 2014 to March 2, 2015. They say this includes names, birthdates, social security numbers and academic information. Some students told News 3 that the breach is concerning.
“Well I thought that was actually kind of creepy because being a student at Auburn, you should be protected. All of your information should be protected,” said Antensha Herd, an Auburn Sophomore.
Officials say the security error did not involve any financial information. They say it came from a device's program that was installed to replace a server.
Officials say the server has been secured and there is no sign of personal information being misused. The university says it is reviewing its data storage policies.
"It kind of freaks me out,” said Chris Gambling, who was on Auburn's campus on Friday. “I think it's disheartening to hear that people's personal information can just get throw out there like that.">
Officials say those affected have been contacted and offered two years of credit monitoring and identity protection.
The identities of 14,000 students and staff were compromised in a 2013 cyber-attack. At the time -- there was no evidence the personal information was used.
