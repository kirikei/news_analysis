Clinton rises in Forbes world’s most powerful women rankings
NEW YORK — German Chancellor Angela Merkel for a fifth year tops the Forbes list of the world’s most powerful women, but Hillary Clinton is snapping at her heels, the magazine said on Tuesday.
Behind them came Melinda Gates, who co-chairs the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with her billionaire philanthropist husband, US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and General Motors CEO Mary Barra.
International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde was in sixth place and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff came in seventh.
The top 10 was rounded out by Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg (No 8), YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki (No9) and US first lady Michelle Obama.
The annual list of the world’s 100 most powerful women includes leaders in eight categories — technology, politics, business, finance, media, entertainment, philanthropy and billionaires.
Ms Clinton, the former first lady and one-time US secretary of state, who last month announced her second run for the White House, was listed at No6 last year.
The magazine has put the German chancellor on the list 10 times in the past 12 years. Newcomers to the list include US pop star Taylor Swift, in at No54 and the youngest at 25; European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, No36; US attorney-general Loretta Lynch, No34; and incoming Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner at No80.
Fifty-nine percent of those on the list are American, including several immigrants. There are 18 from the Asia-Pacific region, 12 from Europe, four each from Latin America and the Middle East and three Africans, Forbes said.
The magazine said the list features eight heads of state, one monarch and 15 billionaires with a total net worth of more than $73.3bn. The top ranking billionaire is Oprah Winfrey at No 12 with a personal net worth of $3bn.
In another measure of influence, the 100 women on the 2014 list have a combined social media footprint that includes 474-million Twitter and YouTube followers, the magazine said.
