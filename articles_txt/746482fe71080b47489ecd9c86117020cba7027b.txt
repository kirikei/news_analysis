Serena Williams powered her way into the second round of the French Open with a 6-2, 6-3 win over the Czech qualifier Andrea Hlavackova on Tuesday.
Williams is going for her third major title at Roland Garros and the American had few problems in dispatching Hlavackova, who is ranked 166th in the world and has never made it past the first round in Paris.
Williams was dominant throughout, hitting five aces and 25 winners, and there were no visible signs of her troublesome right elbow causing discomfort. Four breaks of serve were enough for the world No1 to seal victory in 59 minutes.
The 19-times grand slam champion will now play the American qualifier Alexa Glatch or the German Anna-Lena Friedsam.
