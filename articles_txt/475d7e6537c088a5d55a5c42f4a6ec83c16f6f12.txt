Rating Action:
Moody's upgrades the ratings on $130.2 million of TruPS CDO notes issued by Trapeza Edge CDO, Ltd.
Global Credit Research - 26 May 2015
Moody's also affirms the rating of $107.0 million of notes
New York, May 26, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded the ratings on the following notes  issued by Trapeza Edge CDO, Ltd.:
U.S. $26,000,000 Class A-2 Second  Priority Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes Due 2035, Upgraded to  A1 (sf); previously on May 21, 2014 Upgraded to A3 (sf)
U.S. $32,000,000 Class A-3 Third  Priority Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes Due 2035, Upgraded to  A2 (sf); previously on May 21, 2014 Upgraded to Baa1 (sf)
U.S. $50,500,000 Class B-1 Fourth  Priority Secured Floating Rate Notes Due 2035 (current balance of $49,915,170),  Upgraded to B1 (sf); previously on May 21, 2014 Upgraded to  B3 (sf)
U.S. $22,500,000 Class B-2 Fourth  Priority Secured Fixed Rate Notes Due 2035 (current balance of $22,239,432),  Upgraded to B1 (sf); previously on July 25, 2014 Confirmed  at B3 (sf)
Moody's also affirmed the rating on the following notes:
U.S. $194,000,000 Class A-1 First  Priority Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes Due 2035 (current balance  of $106,987,554), Affirmed Aa3 (sf); previously  on May 21, 2014 Upgraded to Aa3 (sf)
Trapeza Edge CDO, Ltd., issued in August 2005,  is a collateralized debt obligation backed by a portfolio of bank and  insurance trust preferred securities (TruPS).
RATINGS RATIONALE
The rating actions are primarily a result of the deleveraging of the Class  A-1 notes, an increase in the transaction's over-collateralization  ratios, resumption of interest payments of previously deferring  assets, and the improvement in the credit quality of the underlying  portfolio since July 2014.
The Class A-1 notes have paid down by approximately 14.0%  or $17.4 million since July 2014 using principal proceeds  from the redemption of the underlying assets and the diversion of excess  interest proceeds. As a result, the Class A-1 notes'  par coverage has thus improved to 244.7% from 222.9%  since July 2014, by Moody's calculations. Based on  the trustee's May 2015 report, the over-collateralization  ratio of the Class A and B notes are 151.0% and 105.2%  respectively, compared to June 2014 levels of 147.6%  and 105.42%.
The deal has also benefited from improvement in the credit quality of  the underlying portfolio. According to Moody's calculations,  the weighted average rating factor (WARF) improved to 1234 from 1310 in  July 2014. Since July 2014, one previously deferring banks  with a total par of $7.0 million have resumed making interest  payments on their TruPS; two assets with a total par of $16.5  million have redeemed at par.
The key model inputs Moody's used in its analysis, such as  par, weighted average rating factor, and weighted average  recovery rate, are based on its methodology and could differ from  the trustee's reported numbers. In its base case, Moody's  analyzed the underlying collateral pool has having a performing par (after  treating deferring securities as performing if they meet certain criteria)  of $260.9 million, defaulted/deferring par of $18.5  million, a weighted average default probability of 13.08%  (implying a WARF of 1234), and a weighted average recovery rate  upon default of 10.0%. In addition to the quantitative  factors Moody's explicitly models, qualitative factors are  part of rating committee considerations. Moody's considers the  structural protections in the transaction, the risk of an event  of default, recent deal performance under current market conditions,  the legal environment and specific documentation features. All  information available to rating committees, including macroeconomic  forecasts, inputs from other Moody's analytical groups, market  factors, and judgments regarding the nature and severity of credit  stress on the transactions, can influence the final rating decision.
Methodology Underlying the Rating Action
The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach to  Rating TruPS CDOs," published in June 2014. Please see the  Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this  methodology.
Factors that Would Lead to an Upgrade or Downgrade of the Rating:
This transaction is subject to a number of factors and circumstances that  could lead to either an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings, as  described below:
1) Macroeconomic uncertainty: TruPS CDOs performance could be negatively  affected by uncertainty about credit conditions in the general economy.  Moody's has a stable outlook on the US banking sector. Moody's  maintains its stable outlook on the US insurance sector.
2) Portfolio credit risk: Credit performance of the assets collateralizing  the transaction that is better than Moody's current expectations  could have a positive impact on the transaction's performance.  Conversely, asset credit performance weaker than Moody's current  expectations could have adverse consequences on the transaction's  performance.
3) Deleveraging: One source of uncertainty in this transaction is  whether deleveraging from unscheduled principal proceeds and excess interest  proceeds will continue and at what pace. Note repayments that are  faster than Moody's current expectations could have a positive impact  on the notes' ratings, beginning with the notes with the highest  payment priority.
4) Resumption of interest payments by deferring assets: A number  of banks have resumed making interest payments on their TruPS.  The timing and amount of deferral cures could have significant positive  impact on the transaction's over-collateralization ratios and the  ratings on the notes.
5) Exposure to non-publicly rated assets: The deal contains  a large number of securities whose default probability Moody's assesses  through credit scores derived using RiskCalc™ or credit estimates.  Because these are not public ratings, they are subject to additional  uncertainties.
Loss and Cash Flow Analysis:
Moody's applied a Monte Carlo simulation framework in Moody's  CDOROM™ v.2.15.1 to model the loss distribution  for TruPS CDOs. The simulated defaults and recoveries for each  of the Monte Carlo scenarios defined the reference pool's loss distribution.  Moody's then used the loss distribution as an input in its CDOEdge™ cash flow model. CDOROM™ v. 2.15.1 is  available on www.moodys.com under Products and Solutions  -- Analytical models, upon receipt of a signed free license agreement.
The portfolio of this CDO contains mainly TruPS issued by small to medium  sized U.S. community banks and insurance companies that  Moody's does not rate publicly. To evaluate the credit quality  of bank TruPS that do not have public ratings, Moody's uses RiskCalc™,  an econometric model developed by Moody's Analytics, to derive credit  scores. Moody's evaluation of the credit risk of most of the bank  obligors in the pool relies on FDIC Q4-2014 financial data.  For insurance TruPS that do not have public ratings, Moody's relies  on the assessment of its Insurance team, based on the credit analysis  of the underlying insurance firms' annual statutory financial reports.
In addition to the base case analysis, Moody's also conducted sensitivity  analyses to test the impact of a number of default probabilities on the  rated notes relative to the base case modeling results, which may  be different from the current public ratings of the notes. Below  is a summary of the impact of different default probabilities (expressed  in terms of WARF) on all of the rated notes (by the difference in the  number of notches versus the current model output, for which a positive  difference corresponds to lower expected loss):
Assuming a two-notch upgrade to assets with below-investment  grade ratings or rating estimates (WARF of 731)
Class A-1: +2
Class A-2: +2
Class A-3: +2
Class B-1: +3
Class B-2: +2
Assuming a two-notch downgrade to assets with below-investment  grade ratings or rating estimates (WARF of 1755)
Class A-1: -1
Class A-2: -2
Class A-3: -2
Class B-1: -3
Class B-2: -3

Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party  assessment on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets  or financial instruments related to the monitoring of this transaction  in the past six months.
Moody's describes its loss and cash flow analysis in the section "Ratings Rationale" of this press release.
Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios  that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into  account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows.  Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its  assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.
