SFX Entertainment (NASDAQ: SFXE ) has an agreement where CEO and Chairman Robert Sillerman will acquire the rest of the shares of the company for $5.25/share in cash, about $774M in total.
Sillerman already owns 37.4% of the company. Stockholders can elect to retain stock under some conditions.
The price is a 42% premium over the Feb. 24 closing just before Sillerman announced the go-private plan.
The board unanimously approved of the deal, which includes a 45-day go-shop period.
Shares were halted premarket and closed Friday at $4.12; they'll resume trading at 10:15 a.m.

You'll just have to wait and see what will happen when the deal is final. There will be conditions to holding onto it. There's also a suit beginning to determine if the holders are getting a good price.
