LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas lawmakers are set to return to the Capitol later this month to end this year's legislative session.
Legislative leaders on Thursday announced that lawmakers would return April 22 to formally adjourn the legislative session. The General Assembly recessed the session last week after a last-minute fight over a religious objections measure.
The adjournment will likely be quick and mostly ceremonial, since there aren't any vetoed bills that lawmakers are expected to attempt to override.
The Legislature is set to return in February for next year's fiscal session, though Gov. Asa Hutchinson has said a special session is also likely to address the future of those on the state's compromise Medicaid expansion.
