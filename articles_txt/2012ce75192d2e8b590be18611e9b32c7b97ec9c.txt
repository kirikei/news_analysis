Memo to Colin Kaepernick: Jersey number puns and devastating floods don't mix.
The San Francisco 49ers quarterback apparently didn't realize that he couldn't have picked a worse time to mess with Texas until what he intended as a humorous taunt to a rival on Instagram was instead met with outrage.
"I'm so sorry about my insensitive post earlier today," Kaepernick wrote later . "I didn't fully understand how many peopole are struggling in Houston right now and I feel horrible. My prayers are with everyone there."
So what did the 27-year-old athlete write to begin with?
Well, he paired a photo of multiple vehicles submerged in water with the caption, "I warned you the 7torms Coming!!! #Houston."
Instagram
Kaepernick, who wears No. 7, was referencing the 49ers' first game of the 2015 NFL season, an Aug. 15 matchup against the Houston Texans in Texas, but...
Authorities have said that five people are dead, more are missing and at least 4,000 properties in Houston have been damaged after 11 inches of rain fell on the city. Over the last few days, at least 26 people have been killed as a result of storms that ravaged Texas, Oklahoma and northern Mexico.
So it's not as if the flooding wasn't making the national news.
"That was straight disrespect," one critic tweeted Kaepernick, as another noted , "He deleted that picture fast."
"No disrespect intended! Prayers up!" Kaepernick assured his fans.
A #7tormsComing hashtag remains on his Instagram from today, however, accompanying the pictorial caption, "My mother worked too hard for me not to be great."
She worked too hard for him not to be a lot of things. But presumably, lesson learned.
