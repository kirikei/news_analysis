NEWARK  — Sen. Robert Menendez is continuing to speak out against corruption charges leveled against him this month.
Menendez went on "Fox News Sunday" with host Chris Wallace and reiterated that he's innocent and will be vindicated when all the facts come out.
Menendez was indicted April 1 and is accused of accepting nearly $1 million worth of gifts and travel from a longtime friend in exchange for political favors.
Menendez denied he betrayed the public's trust, and said once the facts are known, "I know that I will be vindicated and that we will win."
Menendez also said he can't imagine the Obama administration brought the prosecution against him because of his opposition to the administration on policy on Cuba and Iran, as some have speculated.
