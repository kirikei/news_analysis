Rauner suspends $26 million in Illinois health, other money

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Gov. Bruce Rauner has suspended $26 million in social services and public health grants to narrow a $1.6 billion budget gap.
Included is $7 million to pay for the funerals and burials of public aid recipients; $3 million apiece for immigrant, teen and smoking-cessation programs; and nearly $4 million for autism, HIV and AIDS awareness and other community programs.
Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly says the governor's office worked with the Departments of Human Services and Public Health "to see which grants could be suspended and (then) prioritized essential services."
In March, Rauner suspended an uncertain amount in parks and recreation grants. The budget deal the Republican negotiated with a Democratic-led Legislature allows him to scour state-agency grants and find those lines that can best sustain cuts -- at least temporarily.
