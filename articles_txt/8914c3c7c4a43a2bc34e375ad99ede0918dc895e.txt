Game 4 of the Cavaliers and Hawks Eastern Conference Finals was over well before the clock hit triple zero. By the fourth quarter the Cavaliers were just having fun, and when Matthew Dellavedova put back a ridiculous and-one the place went crazy.

As insane as the put back was, that wasn’t nearly the best part. The best part was definitely the reaction from the rest of the Cavaliers fans and the fans. If no one else does, it’s pretty obvious everyone in the Cavaliers world loves Dellavedova.

JR Smith asking the crowd for more as the "Delly" chants start.
 
This playoff run for Dellavedova has been just bananas. At this point he is going to be the Finals MVP and get chased out of town by whomever the Cavaliers play.
