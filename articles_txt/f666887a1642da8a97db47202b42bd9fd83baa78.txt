The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority’s new executive director, James Good, says, “We’ve had a lot of progress in a lot of areas, but we still have a long way to go.” He’s right.
From 1982 to 2009, the city’s population declined about 25 percent. Yet the amount of water supplied by PWSA increased by 25 percent over the same period. According to its own planning document, “The divergence of population and water demand indicates that the amount of non-revenue water in the PWSA system has increased over the past 30 years.” Indeed, the document shows that 25 percent of the water supplied in 2009 was lost to leaks. These losses are far in excess of national standards.
Leaks are not only costly but also represent places where contaminants can enter the water before it reaches consumers. There is no indication from PWSA publicly available documents that there has been any progress made on this front.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, a water loss control strategy starts with a water audit, which establishes performance indicators. These indicators serve as benchmarks that allow comparisons with other water supply systems. The PWSA publishes operational performance data. But it does not do this kind of benchmarking.
Consequently, this does not allow the PWSA to effectively identify areas where it might learn from other suppliers how to improve its operations. And it prevents both public officials who serve on its board and its customers, who pay more than $100 million per year for the services PWSA supplies, from knowing how the PWSA stacks up against other suppliers.
