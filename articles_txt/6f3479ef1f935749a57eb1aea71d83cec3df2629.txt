Rating Action:
 
Global Credit Research - 27 May 2015
JPY3.8 billion in Debt Securities affected
Tokyo, May 27, 2015 -- Moody's SF Japan K.K. has assigned a provisional rating  to the Asahi Kasei Hebel Haus® New Master Trust RMBS Series11 Senior  Beneficial Interests backed by residential mortgage loans originated by  Asahi Kasei Mortgage Corporation.
This is the eleventh issuance through this master trust program.
The rating addresses the expected loss posed to investors by the final  maturity date. The structure allows for timely payments of interest  (dividend) and ultimate payment of principal by the final maturity date.
Moody's issues provisional ratings in advance of the final sale of the  securities. These ratings, however, represent Moody's  preliminary credit opinions only. Upon a conclusive review of the  transaction and associated documentation, Moody's will endeavor  to assign definitive ratings to the securities. Definitive ratings  may differ from provisional ratings.
The complete rating action is as follows:
Transaction Name: Asahi Kasei Hebel Haus® New Master Trust RMBS  Series11 Senior Beneficial Interests
Class, Issue Amount, Scheduled Dividend Rate, Rating
Class A Fixed Senior Beneficial Interests, JPY3.8 billion,  Fixed, (P)Aaa (sf)
Closing Date (scheduled): June 18, 2015
Final Maturity Date: May 29, 2054
Underlying Asset: Residential mortgage loans
Originator/Seller/Servicer: Asahi Kasei Mortgage Corporation ("Asahi  Kasei Mortgage")
Asset Trustee: Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation
Arranger: Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.,  Ltd. ("MUMSS")
Underwriter: MUMSS
Subordination:
Class A Fixed Senior Beneficial Interests: Approx. 6.9%
* The formula used to calculate the subordination in place for this  transaction is as follow.
Subordination = 1-A/B, where A equals the principal  amount of the Senior Beneficial Interests, and B equals the initial  outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loan pool corresponding  to the Senior Beneficial Interests. The degree of subordination  does not include the amount of the cash reserves for the negative carry  risk.
RATINGS RATIONALE
The Seller entrusts an additional pool of its residential mortgage loans  and all related rights (including the mortgage rights on collateralized  properties securing the recourse rights to obligors, but excluding  the rights on the Group Life Insurance) and cash to the Asset Trustee,  based on the master trust agreement between both parties. In turn,  the Seller receives the Seller Beneficial Interests and the Negative Carry  Reserve Beneficial Interests. At the same time, the principal  of the Reserve Beneficial Interests are increased. The Seller Beneficial  Interests is divided into Class A Fixed Senior Beneficial Interests ("Senior  Beneficial Interests") and Subordinated Beneficial Interests.  The latter is combined with the existing Subordinated Beneficial Interests.
The entrustment of the residential mortgage loans is perfected against  third parties via registration pursuant to the Perfection Law.  Notification of the entrustment to the obligors of the receivables is  not made unless certain events occur.
The Seller sells the Senior Beneficial Interests to the investors through  the underwriter, and retains the Subordinated Beneficial Interests  and the Negative Carry Reserve Beneficial Interests. The transfer  of the Senior Beneficial Interests is perfected against relevant obligors  and third parties under Article 94 of Japan's Trust Law.
The Seller acts as the Servicer, under the Servicing Agreement with  the Asset Trustee. The transaction does not have a third-party  Back-up Servicer in place that can take over actual servicing operations.  However, the Asset Trustee appoints an eligible Back-up Servicer  by entering into a new servicing agreement if any back-up servicer  preparation events occur.
The Senior Beneficial Interests is redeemed in a monthly, pass-through  manner. If certain conditions are met, a part of Subordinated  Beneficial Interests can be redeemed.
Interest collections (after paying expenses and dividends) are transferred  to the Principal Account up to the amount of the outstanding balance of  defaulted loans -- excluding the aggregate amount of these  loans, which are repurchased by the Seller (defaulted trapping mechanism).
If any early amortization events occur, the dividends payment to  the Subordinated Beneficial Interests is suspended, and the excess  spread is used to redeem the Senior Beneficial Interests. Key early  amortization events include the occurrence of a servicer replacement event.
Commingling risk is covered by the servicer's advance payment of collections.  The servicer advances scheduled collection amounts, and, if  certain trigger events occur, then advances the expected prepayment  collection amounts.
A cash reserve is maintained to provide liquidity for shortages in scheduled  payments of the Senior Beneficial Interests as well as trust fees,  set-up fees for a Back-up Servicer and so forth.  Servicing fees for a Back-up Servicer are funded when certain trigger  events occur.
The rating is based mainly on the credit quality of the receivables,  the transaction structure, and the servicer's experience.
Having analyzed both the obligors' attributes and the originator's  historical performance, Moody's estimated an expected cumulative  gross loss rate of 2.0%. Moody's also determined  its portfolio Expected Loss (EL) of 0.4% and MILAN Credit  Enhancement (CE) of 4.0% for the master pool. In  addition, Moody's determined a probability loss distribution  to use the portfolio EL and the MILAN CE and conducted a cash flow analysis  with multiple portfolio loss scenarios of the distribution.
In this Master Trust Program, even if the corresponding loan pool  deteriorates, the Senior Beneficial Interests could ultimately use  excess cash -- after the redemption of the Senior Beneficial  Interests of the other series -- to redeem itself.  Therefore, Moody's determines the required subordination after considering  the volatility of the portfolio loss, based on the attributes in  the master pool.
Moody's assumes that, given the structure of the transaction  as well as other factors, the risk of interruption to the cash flow  from the assets in the event of the seller's or the asset trustee's  bankruptcy is sufficiently minimized to achieve the rating assigned.
Asahi Kasei Mortgage Corporation is a mortgage bank which was established  in 2004, is headquartered in Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo,  and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Asahi Kasei Homes Corporation.  The Asahi Kasei Homes Corporation conducts housing business under the  Asahi Kasei Group, in which Asahi Kasei Corporation is a holding  company.
Moody's conducted an on-site review of Asahi Kasei Mortgage (Originator/Servicer),  focusing on its business franchise as the Originator and its underwriting  criteria. Moody's also reviewed the Asahi Kasei Mortgage's  operations as servicer and considers it sufficiently capable of servicing  the pool.

The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach  to Rating RMBS Using the MILAN Framework" (Japanese) published in January  2015. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com  for a copy of this methodology.
Factors that would lead to a downgrade of the rating:
The primary factor that could lead to a downgrade of the rating is worse  performance of the underlying assets than Moody's expected.
If the expected cumulative gross loss rate of 2.0% for the  pool and the MILAN CE of 4.0% for the master pool used in  determining the initial rating were changed to 4.0%/8.0%  or 6.0%/12.0%, the model output would  change to Aaa or Aa1 respectively (the "parameter sensitivities").
Parameter Sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of  the security might migrate over time; rather they are designed to  provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change  if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed.  The analysis assumes that the transaction has not aged, and does  not factor structural features such as sequential payment effect.  Parameter Sensitivities reflect only the ratings impact of each scenario  from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. Qualitative  factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process,  so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from  the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.
REGULATORY DISCLOSURES
For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity  analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity  to Assumptions of the disclosure form.
Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party assessment  on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets or financial  instruments in this transaction.
The analysis relies on an assessment of collateral characteristics to  determine the collateral loss distribution, that is, the function  that correlates to an assumption about the likelihood of occurrence to  each level of possible losses in the collateral. As a second step,  Moody's evaluates each possible collateral loss scenario using a  model that replicates the relevant structural features to derive payments  and therefore the ultimate potential losses for each rated instrument.  The loss a rated instrument incurs in each collateral loss scenario,  weighted by assumptions about the likelihood of events in that scenario  occurring, results in the expected loss of the rated instrument.
Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that  stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account  the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows.  Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions  of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.
