The Arizona Senate voted Wednesday to abolish the Department of Weights and Measures — but not in the way sought by Gov. Doug Ducey.
That agency is responsible for everything from verifying the accuracy of scales and grocery store scanners to whether Arizonans who purchase gasoline are getting a full gallon.
Ducey had proposed splitting up its duties among three separate agencies. But that drew concerns from businesses that questioned both the need for the split as well as the effect it will have.
The final version of HB 2480 would simply transfer virtually all of the responsibilities to the existing Agriculture Department. The main exception will be regulation of taxis and ridesharing companies, which would go to the Department of Transportation.
