Two Republican presidential hopefuls said they support religious freedom laws like the original versions that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson endorsed, before backing away from them amid public backlash. The original versions would have protected religious liberties without condoning discrimination, they said.
Former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said on CBS's “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he had hoped Pence would not revise the law he initially passed. Pence came under national scrutiny when he signed a religious freedom bill that sparked boycotts and protests among those who feared it would legalize discrimination against lesbians and gays.
The now-revised language is acceptable but “doesn't really open the debate up on some of the current issues,” Santorum said. The revised language provides a “pretty limited view of what religious freedom is in the workplace,” he said, and does not push as hard as the original version did to protect religious liberties. Tolerance is a two-way street, he said.
“We aren't for discrimination against any person. I think no business should discriminate against you because of who you are,” Santorum said.
Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisana said on NBC's “Meet the Press” that he was disappointed that the religious freedom laws in the two states were revised.
“There used to be a bipartisan consensus in this country around religious liberty saying that as Americans we don't all have to agree with each other, but we should respect each other's rights and freedom,” Jindal said. “And that's what this debate is about: Are we going to use government to force people to contradict their own sincerely held beliefs?”
Religious leaders discussed the law on Sunday news shows.
Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Washington and the former bishop of Pittsburgh, said on “Fox News Sunday” that no one should be forced to follow or accept the actions of another person.
The word “discrimination” is being used in different ways, Wuerl said.
“I wonder if, across the board, we're not seeing different measuring rods being used,” he said. “Why would it be discrimination for a Catholic university to say, ‘We're not going to allow a gay rights or an abortion rights group to have their program on our campus,' and it not be discrimination for that group to insist that the Catholic school change its teaching?”
If the same measures are used, Wuerl said, he believes there will be a way to “recognize the dignity of everyone and at the same time recognize the freedom and the rights, especially religious liberty of everyone.”
Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York said there is a delicate balance between religious conviction and civil rights.
“It's tough to balance religious conviction. But it's easier to ignore religious freedom than it is today the more popular issues,” Dolan said on NBC's “Meet the Press.”
