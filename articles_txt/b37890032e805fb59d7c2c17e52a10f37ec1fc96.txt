ROCK HILL, South Carolina — Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is making another campaign swing through South Carolina.
The Republican presidential contender starts his visit in this early-voting state on Friday with a town hall meeting in Rock Hill. After that, he'll visit with people at the Beacon Drive-In Restaurant in Spartanburg before addressing a Republican women's reception in Greenville.
On Saturday, Cruz is making a lunch stop at Palmetto Pig BBQ in Columbia. Later in the day, he's scheduled to attend a Republican club meeting in Aiken.
The South Carolina trip follows a similar series of visits in Iowa, another early presidential state.
