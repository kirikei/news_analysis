Blonde Kim Kardashian Channels Marilyn Monroe for Sexy Vogue Brazil Cover -- See the Photos!
Kim Kardashian poses for Vogue Brazil's June 2015 body issue
Some Like It Hot! Kim Kardashian put her platinum blonde hair phase to good use and channeled Marilyn Monroe for a shoot with Vogue Brazil. The E! reality star’s two covers for the magazine’s June 2015 body issue were released on Tuesday, May 26.
On one cover, Kanye West’s wife, who shocked the Internet when she went bright blonde this past March, dons a pair of sexy black leather gloves while reclining on a leopard blanket, showing off her ample cleavage a la the 1960s sex icon.
The second cover showcases Kardashian’s curves as she poses in a cropped turtleneck sweater and fitted black skirt, leaving her midriff and blonde locks the center of attention.
While it’s unclear if Kardashian went blonde just for the shoot, her colorist Lorri Goddard told Us Weekly in an exclusive interview at the time that it was just the right time for a “color adventure” for North West's mom.
"It's something she's said outright that she's been thinking about for a while, but the time just hasn't been right,” the co-owner of Goddard + Braff told Us of the drastic decision to go platinum. The process, which took nearly four hours, was a “special, creative one for the whole team,” Goddard added. “[It's] a really glamorous, rebellious, sexy, and chic color. And as you can see, she wears it very well."
