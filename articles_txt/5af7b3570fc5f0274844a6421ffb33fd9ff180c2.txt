Rep. Delaney holding western Md. workshop for veterans having problems with care or benefits
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  
HAGERSTOWN, Maryland — Congressman John Delaney is visiting Hagerstown to meet with military service veterans.
The Maryland Democrat is inviting veterans or their families to a workshop Wednesday morning to discuss any problems they're having with the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Delaney says the U.S. government has a sacred obligation to provide veterans with the best care. He's co-sponsoring legislation to expand the Veterans Choice Program, which enables veterans to seek medical care from private providers when a VA facility is too far from home or a local VA facility has long wait times.
Delaney says the program doesn't apply to veterans who need specialized care, including many in western Maryland. He says the proposed legislation would fix that.
