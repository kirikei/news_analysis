Hawaii Governor Says Telescope Construction Will Continue On Sacred Summit
More than a month after halting work on a controversial telescope on Mauna Kea, Gov. David Ige announced Tuesday that construction on the Thirty Meter Telescope will proceed.
Hawaii Gov. David Ige on Tuesday announced that construction of a controversial giant telescope on the summit of the Big Islandâs Mauna Kea has a right to proceed and that the state plans to support the project.
Igeâs announcement follows an April 7 declaration to halt work on the Thirty Meter Telescope, which had become a point of contention, leading to the arrests of dozens of people protesting construction on a site Hawaiians consider sacred.
The governor did not say when construction of the $1.4 -billion telescope will resume. While building on the summit ceased for the past month, parts of the telescope have continued to be constructed elsewhere , including in India, China, and California.

Ige on Tuesday also said that âwe have failed the mountain,â and in particular blamed the University of Hawaii, who he said âmust do a better job in its stewardship of the mountain.â
Ige said the university must make a commitment that there will be no more construction beyond the area where the Thirty Meter Telescope is planned for and called for at least one-fourth of the existing telescopes to be decommissioned by the time TMT is completed. He also wants the university to return all lands not needed for astronomy to the Department of Land and Natural Resources, which he said included more than 10,000 acres.
The govenor also called on the university to revisit prior lease terms for the existing telescopes, and to explore whether greater payments were due.
Ige plans to create a Mauna Kea Cultural Council that he said would add significant value in providing a cultural aspect to the management of the mountain. Supporting TMT would not be required for those who serve on the council, he said, adding that they would work with the Department of Land and Natural Resources and the governorâs office to make sure the host culture is respected in the future.
Ige also called to improve support for Hawaiian students interested in science and technology through scholarships, with first priority going to students on the Big Island.

In a statement, Henry Yan, who sits on the TMT International Observatory Board, said his organization was grateful for Igeâs leadership and statement of support, and that they would âwork with the framework he has put forth.â
âWe know we have a lot of work ahead of us,â the statement added. âWe appreciate that there are still people who are opposed to the project, and we will continue to respectfully listen and work with them to seek solutions. We also want to acknowledge and thank our many supporters on the Big Island and beyond.â
In response to a question from BuzzFeed News about when construction would resume, representatives for the TMT International Observatory said âwe donât have that information.â

The arrests in early April only seemed to give more energy to the anti-telescope movement, which has continued via demonstrations even during the work shutdown. Protesters meet on a daily basis at the summit of Mauna Kea and celebrities, including Jason Momoa, who is Native Hawaiian, have used social media to garner attention for their message.
Telescopes have been built on the summit of Mauna Kea since the late 1960s, where there are now more than a dozen telescopes. But a growing Hawaiian rights movement and mismanagement of the land lead to an increase in the recent protest movement.
Many Hawaiians consider the summit their birthplace, where earth mother Papahanaumoku and the sky father Wakea created the islands. It is also home to a fragile ecosystem, where the threatened wekiu bug has been impacted by development.
The protests spread from the Big Island to neighboring islands, as well as across the Pacific Ocean. Protesters have rallied in front of the Thirty Meter Telescope headquarters located in Pasadena, California, on multiple occasions .
In Honolulu, protesters marched from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to the State Capitol on April 21, arriving at Igeâs office to deliver a petition signed by more than 53,000 people.
At the end of April, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs â a state agency intended to advocate for Native Hawaiian issues â voted to rescind its official support, leaving the organizationâs stance neutral.
However, there has been some support for the telescope. An 18-year-old Hawaiian student, Mailani Neal, on the Big Island started a petition called âWe Support TMT,â which currently has more than 7,000 signatures.
