WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is giving his health care law an eight out of a 10, and calls a lawsuit hanging over it "the last gasp" from opponents.
Obama tells ABC News he doesn't give it a 10 is because things can always be improved.
He says the biggest challenge is getting more states to expand Medicaid coverage. He says "stubbornness" among state leaders who aren't using the benefit is "based on ideology, not on wise public health policy."
The Supreme Court is expected to rule by late June whether the subsidies are legal in most states.
Obama tells CNN he doesn't anticipate justices "would make such a bad decision" to rule against the subsidies. He says such a ruling would force millions to lose insurance they can't afford without subsidies.
