Google honours Sally Ride, the first American woman to travel to space on her 64th birthday by dedicating the todayâs Google doodle to this chivalrous astronaut.
Sally Ride, who was born in Los Angeles, died of pancreatic cancer on July 23, 2012. Ride is credited as being the first American woman in space, the youngest person ever in space at the age of 32 and also to be the first known LGBT person in space.
Tam O'Shaughnessy, Ride's life partner stated in a web post, âWith whimsy, it expresses Sallyâs sense of fun and adventure, and her ability to inspire young peopleâ.
To pay homage to Ride, Google unveiled a series of five different âBehind the Doodleâ animations that portray the inspiring life journey of Ride which will show up each time a person visits Googleâs home page.
The American pioneer is being celebrated by Google which has also devoted a two-and-a-half-minute animated video narrated by Artist Olivia Huynh listing the important milestones in Rideâs life. Rideâs journey from being a junior tennis player to a doctoral student at Stanford and then heading on to become the American space star has been vividly described.
Ride is said to be one among 8,000 who responded to the ad to become an astronaut. There on from 1978 to about 1988, Ride stayed at NASA, twice undertaking flights aboard the space shuttle Challenger. Her first mission was accomplished in 1983.
Ride joined the University of California, San Diego faculty as a physics professor in 1989 and became a director of the University of Californiaâs California Space Institute. In 2001, she founded the educational company called âSally Ride Scienceâ.
Ride dedicated her life to inspire next generation, especially girls, to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math.
Ride is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nationâs highest civilian honour and efforts are being made to include Rideâs likeness in the US Capitolâs Statuary Hall.
