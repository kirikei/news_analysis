SACO, Maine (WHDH) -
Maine Gov. Paul LePage abruptly ended a town hall meeting in Saco Thursday after a former mayor threw a jar of Vaseline at him.
Le Page was on hand to discuss a budget proposal with the community. The woman who threw the Vaseline at him was Joanna Twomey, the former mayor of Biddeford and state legislator. Twomey said she confronted LePage because she believes his budget shifts the burden from the wealthy onto the poor. 
"What he is about to do to this state you have to be out of order," said Twomey. "You cannot live with those policies and not speak up."
Twomey said she threw Vaseline in reference to a comment the governor made back in 2013. At the time, LePage said about Democratic State Sen. Troy Jackson, "He's the first one to give it to people without providing Vaseline."
LePage walked off the stage shortly after the outburst and Twomey was escorted out by security. Residents said they were upset the town hall was cut off.
"It's very frustrating," said Chris Johnson. "I've been trying for several weeks to understand the Governor's budget."
