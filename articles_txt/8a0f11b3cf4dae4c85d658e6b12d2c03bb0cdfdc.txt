NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Chris Christie’s job approval at home has sunk to a new low.
A Rutgers-Eagleton poll out Thursday finds 54 percent of registered voters surveyed disapprove of the job Christie is doing. Forty-one percent approve.
And more say the state is on the wrong track than at any point in his tenure.
The poll comes as Christie is preparing for a likely presidential run.
It also finds the Republican governor down to new lows when it comes to his handling of Superstorm Sandy rebuilding as well as taxes and the state budget.
Still, Christie’s overall favorability has Improved. Now 48 percent have an unfavorable view verses 53 percent in February.
The poll of 722 registered voters has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
