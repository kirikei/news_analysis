VATICAN CITY â Pope Francis told an Argentine newspaper, La Voz Del Pueblo that he never watches television for the good reason that 25 years ago he had made a promise to the Virgin of Carmine that he would no longer watch TV.
The 78-year-old leader of 1.2 billion Catholics confessed that he never watched TV since 1990 and only reads one newspaper â Italian daily la Repubblica, neither has he logged on to the Internet.
Hailing from Buenos Aires, he did confess he misses taking the subway and eating pizza.
âTo go out walking the streets. That is what I miss most, the peacefulness of walking the streets or maybe going to a pizzeria to eat a good pizza. [They can be ordered in] but it is not the same thing. The great thing is to go there to eat it . . . When I was cardinal [in Buenos Aires] I loved to walk the streets, take the bus or the metro. The city fascinates me. In my soul I am a citizen,â he said.
