Well, four pitches later, the game was tied, 3-3.
Thinking back, maybe the Mets should have asked him to pick off a couple of runners before he left.
So for all his nine-strikeout work, which looked like the perfect follow-up complement to an overpowering outing against the Cardinals on Thursday, deGrom wound up with his first no-decision of the season. The 6-foot-4 right-hander seemed to deserve a better fate. He gave up six hits, all singles, with two of them in the eighth, and he didn’t walk anybody.
Manager Terry Collins and deGrom both credited some mechanical tweaks that have brought him back to last season’s form.
“Definitely, I think I’m able to get the ball down in the zone where I want it versus when I was struggling with my mechanics, I was struggling to get the ball down so I think that’s helped out.” deGrom said. “It’s a confidence thing, too.”
DeGrom, though, didn’t get the victory as the Mets’ bullpen had a rare failure behind him. Reliever Hansel Robles surrendered a two-run triple to Ben Revere on a 1-0 fastball and then an RBI single to Freddy Galvis on an 0-1 slider — and according to ESPN Stats, it was the first time runners left on base by deGrom scored. The Phillies eventually took a 4-3 lead and the Mets tied it in the home eighth, forcing extra innings. That made deGrom an even smaller footnote to the night that ended in a 10-inning, 5-4 Mets victory at Citi Field.
“It was a good game for us to hang in there and come back and win,” Collins said, “because Jake was outstanding.”
Maybe not as outstanding as his 11-strikeout masterpiece against the Cardinals, but pretty darn good on its own.
“The most important thing is we got the win. I went out there trying to keep us in position to get the win and we got the win,” said deGrom, who added he was able to “locate fastballs on both sides of the plate and then I had good command of my off-speed” in order to keep the Phillies at bay until the eighth.
But in that inning, deGrom’s pitch count — and Collins said you can expect somewhat higher pitch counts with a six-man rotation — was not the only thing rising.
“At the start of the inning you could see the ball was starting to come up and the velocity was coming down,” Collins said. “He was putting it in the middle of the plate and they were taking pretty good swings.”
So after 105 pitches and a couple of singles, deGrom exited. But the change in mechanics from his work with pitching coach Dan Warthen paid off again.
“That has helped out a lot,” deGrom said, “and I think it has given me a little more confidence going out there.”
