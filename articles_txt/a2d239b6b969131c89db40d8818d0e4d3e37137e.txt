CHICAGO — The polls for early voting have closed for the upcoming Chicago mayoral election — but the candidates for mayor aren’t done campaigning, of course.
As the polls closed on early voting, Rahm Emanuel and Jesus “Chuy” Garcia continued to stump for any undecided voters out there. And they did it by surrounding themselves with friendly crowds.
At a South Side community center, Emanuel was joined by different community organizations and Atlanta’s mayor who flew in to campaign for Emanuel — he also seemed to understand Emanuel’s perceived not-so-friendly personality.
In contrast, Commissioner Garcia joined the Polish community at a traditional Easter basket ceremony.
The commissioner kept his comments brief and left the mayor out, but Emanuel took several shots at Chuy.
The Chicago Board of Elections added staff Saturday to help get people in and out of polling places for early voting.
Election Day is Tuesday.
