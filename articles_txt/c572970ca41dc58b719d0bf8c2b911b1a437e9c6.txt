Supreme Court to hear Texas case that could change how voting maps drawn

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court said Tuesday that it will hear a case next year brought by two Texans that takes aim at perhaps the court’s most important voting rights doctrine — the principle of one person, one vote.
If successful, the case would radically change the way lawmakers draw voting maps every 10 years and could require every voting map in the country to be redrawn, from Congress to city council.
The Supreme Court created the one-man, one-vote rule in 1964, when it ruled that the 14th Amendment requires voter maps to be based on population, not geographic boundaries. In Texas, for instance, that meant that each Senate district in the maps redrawn in 2013 contained about 811,000 people.
It’s why seven Senate districts slice through Dallas, but a single district — the 28th near Lubbock — can stretch across all or parts of 51 counties in far West Texas.
But in their 2014 lawsuit, lawyers for Titus County GOP chairwoman Sue Evenwel and Edward Pfenninger of Montgomery County argued that only the number of eligible voters, not total residents, should count when deciding how to draw a voting district. Those ineligible to vote — children, immigrants, felons and the mentally incapacitated — shouldn’t count, they said.
“The equal protection right secures more than ballot access,” their lawyers argued. “It also ensures that the vote of any one voter once cast is accorded equal weight relative to every other voter.”
Conservative scholars hailed the court’s announcement, saying it’s time for the court to decide whether one person, one vote really means one voter, one vote
“The case takes up an issue the court has not decided,” said former Federal Election Commissioner Hans von Spakovsky, who now manages the voting rights reform campaign for the Heritage Foundation. “This is becoming a bigger and bigger problem as we have a larger and larger number of people who aren’t U.S. citizens living here.”
Others in Texas were alarmed, however. The changes could weaken the influence of voters in cities, where the percentage of residents who are not eligible to vote is often higher than in rural areas. And others asserted that lawmakers and local officials should represent the interests of all people, whether or not they are eligible to vote.
Matt Angle, director of the Democratic-affiliated Lone Star Project PAC, said using another district-drawing standard would let legislators dilute the influence of urban and minority-majority areas.
“It’s a not-thinly-veiled attempt to diminish minority voting strength in Texas,” said Angle, who’s been involved for more than two decades in the often bitter politics of redistricting in Texas.
Nina Perales, vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said that while a different method might work in other states, “it's a very bad idea” in a state as diverse as Texas.
“The effects in Texas would be so dramatic in terms of stripping representation,” she said. “[The plaintiffs] want to force certain groups of people into heavily overpopulated districts in order to reduce their impact.”
The Supreme Court has never defined what it meant by “one person, one vote,” wading into what had until the 1950s been the exclusive province of state lawmakers. And when it did adopt the rule, it left the states to decide whether to draw their maps based on voter rolls or total population.
Since then, every state has chosen to do so based on total population, with minor variances.
“It’s really interesting because it asks the court to explain, for the first time, what is the one-person, one-vote doctrine really about?” Stanford University law professor Nathaniel Persily said. “Is it about equal representation of a community? Is it about evenly distributing the workload of legislators?”
The logistics of a new standard, he said, would be a nightmare.
“There is no national list of citizens out there. You don’t have data to know for sure who is a citizen and who is not. The Supreme Court is not going to order the lawmakers to essentially create a national list of citizens, something we have never had before.”
