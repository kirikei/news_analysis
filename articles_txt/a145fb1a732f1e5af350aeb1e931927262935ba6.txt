BALTIMORE (WJZ)– As the city deals with a surge in violence, it’s also left with a bill for $20-million dollars which is the the cost of last month’s riots.
According to our media partner, The Baltimore Sun , the $20-million includes overtime pay for police and firefighters, destruction to city-owned property and money owed to jurisdictions that sent resources to Baltimore — such as Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania.
The expenses will go before the board of estimates on Wednesday.
