Napa: Prepare for 2017 Social Security Cuts
As the Social Security retirement age increases, other cuts are taking place that could seriously impact your lifetime benefit.

More than 30 years ago, a bi-partisan effort between Republican President Ronald Reagan and the Democrat-led Congress produced changes in Social Security to ensure its solvency.
Those changes include increasing the retirement age from 65 to 67. It’s already at 66, with the next phase of incremental increases coming between 2017 and 2022. What is little noticed is what’s happening to benefits for people who choose early retirement at 62.
When the retirement age was 65, someone choosing to claim Social Security benefits at 62 suffered a 20 percent reduction in benefits. When the full retirement age reaches 67, the early retirement penalty will be a 30 percent reduction. The drop will be enough to push some recipients below the poverty level if they depend wholly upon Social Security.
If things don’t change, you can plan accordingly. The wildcard is politics. Several presidential candidates are proposing further changes to Social Security.
But until Congress and some future president agree on how to revamp the system, the focus is on 2017—a further drop in benefits if you plan to take Social Security at 62.
