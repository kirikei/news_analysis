WASHINGTON (AP) — Some teenagers get driving lessons from their parents. Other teens are taught by licensed instructors.
But Malia Obama isn't your average 16-year-old: Her driving lessons were provided by the U.S. Secret Service.
Asked who taught Malia how to drive, first lady Michelle Obama told celebrity chef and daytime talk-show host Rachael Ray in an interview that it was the armed agents who provide around-the-clock security for the family.
"The Secret Service, actually, because they wouldn't let me in the car with her," Mrs. Obama said in an excerpt of the interview that was released by Ray's program. The full interview is set to air Thursday.
Mrs. Obama hasn't driven herself in seven or eight years, she said.
She added that driving gives Malia "a sense of normalcy," helping her feel like the rest of her friends who are also driving. "And my kids have got to learn how to live in the world like normal kids."
When Ray says that the Obamas seem "so grounded," the first lady replies that her "hope is just to make sure that they (her daughters) come out of this thing as functioning adults, you know?"
Mrs. Obama, whose younger daughter Sasha is 13, said Malia also drives herself around Washington.
