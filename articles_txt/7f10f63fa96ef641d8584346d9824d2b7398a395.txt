JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -
Gov. Jay Nixon said on Friday that an increase in state revenue lets him release budgeted funds that he withheld last June.  The funds include money for a medical school in Springfield -- a partnership between the University of Missouri and CoxHealth and Mercy Springfield -- and for an occupational therapy program at Missouri State University in Springfield.

The Legislature approved the appropriations for this fiscal year, which runs from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, but the governor wasn't sure in June that state revenue would cover all the budgeted expenses.   The state constitution gives governors the power to not make appropriated expenditures to keep the state budget in balance.
The University of Missouri wants to establish a clinical campus in Springfield in an expansion of the university's medical school, but first it needs a 5,000- to 6,000-square-foot building between the city's two major hospitals.
University officials met with city leaders in November 2013 to discuss the $40 million plan that includes spending $36 million to expand the medical school on the university's Columbia campus.
The building in Springfield would house about a dozen full-time employees and be relatively small because medical students coming to Springfield would spend most of their time at Cox South and Mercy hospitals. 
Eight MU students enrolled last summer in the doctor training program slated for Springfield, and MU planned to enroll an additional 35 students next summer.  The MU program would send third and fourth year students to complete their clinicals at CoxHealth and Mercy.
University officials say expansion is necessary to address a projected national shortage of 90,000 physicians by 2020.
The Legislature appropriated $10 million for the medical school in Springfield this fiscal year.   After the withholding, the governor released about half of that amount in February after the state received a lawsuit settlement of $21.5 million from credit rating agency Standard & Poor's.  The release of the funds on Friday is the other half of that appropriation.
For the MSU occupational therapy program, the Legislature appropriated $1.325 million.  The governor released about half that amount in February and the rest on Friday.  That program will be housed in a new building that is under construction on Cherry Street, a block east of Kimbrough Avenue.
The governor also released funds on Friday for preschool programs, libraries, and maintenance of state buildings, among other things.
News release from Springfield-Greene County Libraries:
"Springfield-Greene County Libraries and those statewide will be among the entities that will share the $43 million in funding released by Gov. Jay Nixon. He said Friday he plans to release $43 million of funds immediately after the state took in higher general revenues in March.
"The Springfield-Greene County Libraries joined in a letter-writing and online petition effort with library districts statewide in recent months appealing the governor to release funds critical to the operation of libraries and Internet access for the public. His action released all the monies that he had withheld from state libraries in cities with populations of over 40,000.
“We are extremely pleased that Gov. Nixon this morning announced the release of library funds that have previously been withheld from this year’s budget,” said Library Executive Director Regina Greer Cooper. “Our library district, alone, will receive approximately $200,000, which will allow us to purchase the books, materials and equipment that we had put on hold.

Following an increase in state revenues, $43 million is now available for priorities including education, workforce training, and economic development, Gov. Jay Nixon announced today.
“Last year Missouri added more than 44,000 jobs, and this strong economic momentum has continued into 2015,” said Gov. Nixon. “The recent uptick in revenues reflects the broad-based growth we’re seeing in our economy and allows us to make additional dollars available for education, economic development and other key priorities. Moving forward, I will continue to exercise strict fiscal discipline to balance the budget and make smart investments that will strengthen our economy and our communities.”
State Budget Director Linda Luebbering said Thursday that 2015 fiscal year-to-date net general revenue collections increased 6.8 percent compared to 2014, from $5.57 billion last year to $5.95 billion this year.
The governor noted revenues remain below the levels necessary to fully fund the Fiscal Year 2015 budget passed last year by the General Assembly, which was several hundred million dollars out of balance, with appropriations greatly exceeding projected revenues.  In Missouri, governors have a responsibility to keep the budget in balance throughout the year and ensure spending does not exceed available revenues.

Missouri Preschool Program - $1,500,000
