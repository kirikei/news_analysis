WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — A former Kent County Republican chairman is running for Congress.
Hans Reigle , an assistant professor and assistant director of aviation at Delaware State University , filed paperwork last month to run for Delaware's only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives . Democratic Rep. John Carney now holds the seat.
Reigle says he'll work to improve the nation's educational system and eliminate wasteful spending. Reigle also says he will work to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and strengthen border security.
The former U.S. Air Force Reserve and United Airlines pilot served as mayor of Wyoming from 2005 to 2007 and led the Kent County Republican party from 2010 to 2013.
