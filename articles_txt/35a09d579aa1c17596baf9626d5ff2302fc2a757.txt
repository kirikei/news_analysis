BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — Four of the 16 candidates who applied to become the East Baton Rouge city-parish's top lawyer will be interviewed for the job.
The Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1PfuHea ) a committee decided Monday four lawyers who will interview for the East Baton Rouge Parish attorney job are Michael Adams, principal of Regional Receivership Group LLC; interim Parish Attorney Lea Anne Batson; Joell Keller, vice president of compliance and senior counsel for the Edgen Murray Corporation; and Baton Rouge City Court Administrator Lon Norris.
The committee members, who include some council members and people representing the legal community, plan to interview the top four candidates on April 16.
The council fired previous Parish Attorney Mary Roper in September, saying it lost confidence in her ability to run the Parish Attorney's Office.
