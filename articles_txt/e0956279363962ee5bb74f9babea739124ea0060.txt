About The Author
Kate Glassman Bennett is a fourth-generation Washingtonian who has spent more than a decade covering lifestyle, society, fashion and personalities, beginning in Las Vegas and then returning to D.C. to chronicle power-players and glitterati. During that time, she's written about everything from Wayne Newton's pet penguins to Michelle Obama's elusive personal stylist. She loves the foie gras parfait at Le Diplomate almost as much as she loves C-SPAN.
