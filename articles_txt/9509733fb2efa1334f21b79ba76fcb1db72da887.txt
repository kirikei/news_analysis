CHICAGO (AP) â€” Illinois and federal officials are proposing new dates for the special elections to replace former U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock.
In a document filed Monday in Chicago federal court, the U.S. Department of Justice says it worked with Illinois officials to set a July 7 primary and a Sept. 10 general election.
Schock is a Peoria Republican who represented the 18th Congressional District. He resigned last month amid questions about his office expenses and campaign spending. The Justice Department is investigating.
Under state law, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner had five days to schedule the special elections. He called for them to be held June 8 and July 24, but said the dates were likely to change in order to comply with federal voting law.
A judge must approve the proposed dates.
