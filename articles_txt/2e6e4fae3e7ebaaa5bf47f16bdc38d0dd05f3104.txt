While President Barack Obama called on the Senate to compromise and extend key provisions of the Patriot Act in order to reform Americaâs surveillance capabilities, Sen. Rand Paul said Obama was being âdisingenuousâ and could end the program himself.
In five days, key provisions of the Patriot Act will sunset,   including one that the National Security Agencyâs has used to   justify its ability to search Americansâ phone records. Sen.   Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said that because much of the NSAâs   sweeping authority was cemented under an executive order, Obama   could act alone to repeal the agencyâs power.
âHeâs disingenuous about this. The president started this   program through executive order,â Paul told âCBS This   Morning.â âThe Second Court of Appeals, the court that is right   below the Supreme Court, has said that itâs illegal. Why doesnât   he stop it? Whatâs he waiting for? He started it on his own, he   should stop itâ¦Iâve asked the president repeatedly to stop the   program.â
Paul, also a 2016 presidential candidate, was responding to   President Obamaâs call for the Senate to find a way to extend the   soon-expiring Patriot Act provisions.
"This needs to get done," Obama told reporters in the   Oval Office on Tuesday. "It's necessary to keep the American   people safe and secure."
While the executive order giving the NSA broad spying authority   was implemented in 1981 under President Ronald Reagan, the agency   only began bulk collecting Americanâs phone records during the   George W. Bush administration, via Section 215 of the Patriot   Act. In 2011, Obama reauthorized certain provisions in the law.
However, former National Security Agency contractor Edward   Snowden exposed the agencyâs controversial metadata program in   2013, which led Obama to say last year he would curb some aspects   of the NSAâs authority. He supported passage of the USA Freedom   Act, which would have ended the NSAâs bulk collection of   telephone data and reformed the way it accessed such information,   but the measure failed in the Senate over the weekend.

Paul, who against renewing the Patriot Act without addressing   concerns over surveillance, thinks the data collected by the NSA   under its bulk telephone collection program should be deleted.
âI think it should be purged. I think the information was   collected illegally and should be purged,â Paul told âFox & Friends.â
White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday   afternoon that Obama could not unilaterally end the telephone   bulk collection program.
âThe authorities that are used by our national security   professionals to keep us safe are authorities that are given to   those national security professionals by the Congress, and those   authorities can only be renewed by the United States Congress   through an act of Congress,â said Earnest.
The Senate failed to pass the USA Freedom Act early Saturday   before adjourning for the Memorial Day break, despite the bill   finding easy passage in the House of Representatives. The House   and Senate are in recess for the week, and a House GOP leadership   aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the Associated   Press there were no talks happening between the two chambers.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is calling the   Senate back into session on Sunday, May 31 â just hours before   the midnight deadline â but it's not clear lawmakers will have   any new solution. McConnell complained that the House bill waters   down the bulk collection program that now exists, but   acknowledged that "they passed it by a very large margin. So   that makes it pretty challenging to extend the law as it   is."
The House bill does away with the NSA program over six months but   gives phone companies the responsibility of maintaining phone   records that the government can search. The legislation also   includes tools used by the FBI that make it easier to track   âlone wolfâ terrorism suspects with no connections to   foreign powers. Another provision allows the government to   eavesdrop on suspects who continuously discard their mobile   devices.
