 lNDIANAPOLIS — Kevin Fyffe worked for a decade to enjoy a day like Wednesday. People of all kinds were out and about on trendy Massachusetts Avenue, the main thoroughfare of Indianapolis’ most hip and inclusive neighborhood, basking in the sunlight of the spring thaw. But inside the Metro Nightclub and Restaurant, as he sipped his rum and Diet Coke, Mr. Fyffe was thinking about far-off places like California, Seattle and Portland, Ore.
“I give up on this state,” said Mr. Fyffe, a sixth-generation Hoosier who grew up to the south in small-town Washington, Ind. “After a while, it defeats you. I’m 50 years old. I don’t have a lot of fight left in me. I can’t spend the rest of my time here.”
A mile away at the statehouse, while Mr. Fyffe lamented the current plight of Indiana’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, lawmakers, activists and local business leaders were meeting late into the evening to quiet the outrage by revising the language of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Indiana lawmakers approved those revisions on Thursday, and Gov. Mike Pence signed them into law soon after.
The original law, signed by Gov. Pence last week, was written in a way that could allow private businesses and corporations to discriminate against LGBT people as an expression of their religious freedom and use that defense in court if sued. 
Even though Mr. Fyffe was struggling to see it this week, he knew how far their movement had come. He could remember when the gay bars in Indianapolis were dark places with blackened windows, when life as a homosexual often felt like a scandalous secret. He started to become politically active around 2005, when Indiana legislators were attempting to define marriage in the state constitution as exclusively between a man and woman, and city advocates were pushing for a local ordinance that protected the LGBT community from discrimination. He helped win those battles, rallying and registering voters, because he believed Indiana could be better.
And then last week happened.
“I’m done,” Mr. Fyffe said. “I fit in Indianapolis. The worst part of Indianapolis is that it’s surrounded by Indiana.”
The first religious freedom act was the federal one penned by the late Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy in 1993 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996 to ensure that religious minorities were protected from laws passed by the federal government that had the effect of discriminating against them. Nineteen other states have passed their own, but Indiana’s caused alarm as the first to allow any business to assert religious beliefs, according to Sarah Warbelow, the legal director of the Human Rights Campaign. Since LGBT people are not a protected class in Indiana’s statewide civil rights law, this conservative twist of a law originally written by liberals would have put them even more at risk than they already were.
Under immense pressure from countless corporate powers across the country and locally-based behemoths like the NCAA, which is bringing its Final Four to town this weekend, Republican leaders announced Thursday morning at a statehouse news conference that they have amended the language in the law to include protections for the LGBT community against discrimination based on the law.
Senate President David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma trumpeted the changed language as an important first step that elevated the discussion. They also mimicked Gov. Pence’s comments earlier this week by stressing that a misperception of the law’s intent had driven the whole ordeal. To Indianapolis’ LGBT leaders, though, this was no real repair, only a patch.
“It’s very important to make clear that in the state of Indiana you can still fire someone for being gay, you can still deny someone service at a hotel or restaurant for being gay,” said Jeff Miner, the pastor at LifeJourney Church, a LGBT-friendly congregation in North Indianapolis. “So the so-called fix, it prevents the religious freedom law from being used as a sword to justify discrimination, but that's all it does. The much bigger issue is when will Indiana prevent discrimination against LGBT people by including us in the civil rights statute.”
With the Final Four here this weekend, tens of thousands of people were going to come to Indy Indianapolis whether or not the change was made to RFRA. Now, they will arrive with the idea of Hoosier hospitality at least somewhat restored. Still, the LGBT community will not go away quietly with national attention on their troubles in America’s heartland at an all-time high.
A march planned for Saturday afternoon, before the Duke-Michigan State and Kentucky-Wisconsin national semifinal games that night, will start at the statehouse and end at Lucas Oil Stadium.
“We’re grateful that the NCAA tournament happens to be here this year,” Mr. Miner said, “because the Republican leaders want to put on a good show. Now, they’re caught up in their own games.”
Developing pride
So, Mr. Fyffe wants to leave Indianapolis? Mr. Miner has a message for him and any others who have viewed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as the breaking point: No. Stay.
“I always say to LGBT people in Indiana, you can’t move away,” Mr. Miner said. “If you move away, who’s going to make it safe for future generations of LGBT kids growing up in this state?”
Urban areas surrounded by liberal states constantly beckon. New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, San Diego and even Chicago can sound like paradises. When Mr. Miner demands their loyalty to the mission in Indiana, he does it from an honest place; many years ago, he had to leave in order to find himself.
Of course, it was a different time then. Mr. Miner was raised in Indianapolis, spending his Sundays in fundamentalist Baptist churches where the Bible was read with no regard for opposing viewpoints. He went to Bob Jones University, a conservative private college in Greenville, S.C., to become a pastor. While there, he began to figure out that he had a different sexual preference than his classmates. Feeling unfit for his original calling, he applied to law school at Harvard University and was admitted.
Mr. Miner met his partner while practicing law in Washington, D.C., where he discovered a gay-friendly Christian denomination, the Metropolitan Community Church. It had a much different interpretation of the Bible. Invigorated, Mr. Miner spent the last seven of his 13 years in D.C. taking his church’s course work to become a pastor. After he finished, the top job at LifeJourney opened, and he did not hesitate to return to his home state.
“It was profoundly meaningful to come back to minister where it is not easy and it is desperately needed,” Mr. Miner said.
Metropolitan Community Churches struggled to get off the ground in Indy. Mr. Miner was told a story about how the first one lasted 10 years before a meeting at a parishioner’s house was raided by the police, who heard of a church gathering of gay people and assumed it was a front for a speakeasy.
LifeJourney, which began in 1990, had about 40 members when Mr. Miner arrived in 1997. Because of his law background, he had the confidence to take on politicians and fight for the LGBT community in meaningful ways. It started in 1998 with prayer gatherings outside the statehouse and was ramped up in 2005 when the legislature wanted to amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. That time, Mr. Miner and 150 others disrupted the House Committee vote by praying on their knees and saying “Shame, shame, shame!” and “Father forgive them!” after each “yes” vote. The amendment effort eventually failed in 2008.
Over the next few years, with help from an umbrella organization called Indiana Equality, they funded three separate citywide billboard campaigns. Two of them asked the question “Would Jesus discriminate?” and another cited Bible verses that alluded to men loving each other without condemnation.
In 2011, the same-sex marriage ban was proposed again, before being defeated again in 2014, just before a federal court ruled in June that the equal protection clause of the U.S. constitution required marriage equality in Indiana. Since then, LifeJourney has married 50 to 60 gay couples — the ultimate proof that all of their hard work had finally carved out room for them in the most important spaces.
The best example of the growth of the LGBT community here is its Indy Pride parade. When Nick Murphy first got involved eight years ago, about 15,000 people attended to see about five floats.
“Last year, it was over 100 floats with 30,000 people on the parade route,” said Mr. Murphy, who was president of Indy Pride until September. “And it’s not just the gay community. It’s grown like you’d expect a Hoosier festival to grow.”
In the same period, Indianapolis has blossomed, too, shedding its “Naptown” reputation by becoming a city known for bringing major sporting events like the Super Bowl, the Indy 500, the Final Four and the Big Ten football and men’s basketball championships to town, as well as many corporate conventions.
For the LGBT community, it has begun to feel like a real, vibrant, open city with citizens who have a shared vision for the future regardless of sexual orientation.
But, it is still a city where a bakery can refuse to make rainbow-colored cupcakes for a group of students wanting to celebrate National Coming Out Day, which happened in 2010 at a downtown business.
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as it was written before Thursday’s revisions, only served to pile on.
“It’s already legal for someone to turn me away for being gay,” Mr. Fyffe said. “So why reinforce it?”
Storm of dissent
Only Indiana’s leaders know the real reason the law was passed (many LGBT advocates assume it was in response to gay marriage being allowed). That the lawmakers were willing to push it through even with the Final Four coming to town soon after means that either they didn’t think it would drum up such a storm or they simply didn’t care.
But, the people have spoken.
Scott Wise considers himself a born-again Christian, baptized three years ago. He owns 15 restaurants across the state, including Scotty’s Brewhouse in downtown Indy, and he could not have been more shocked when he first read the implications of the act.
“I just don’t understand how they could not see this tsunami that was building,” Mr. Wise said. “For the first time in my adult life, I’m disappointed that I’m from Indiana. That kind of stings.”
Mr. Wise decided he would speak out. He wrote his opinion on his company’s Facebook page and Web site and made it clear that he would be welcoming all LGBT visitors to his establishment for a party tonight to kick off Final Four weekend.
Cyd Zeigler says he will be there. He is the co-founder of OutSports.com, and he would have attended the Final Four before the the religious freedom act became a story. Now, on Saturday morning at the National Association of Basketball Coaches conference, he will be a panelist on basketball and LGBT issues with former NBA player Jason Collins, the first current professional athlete to come out, in 2013, and Derrick Gordon, the first current college basketball player to come out, in 2014.
“As soon as I saw this was happening, I was like, ‘Are they going to screw this up and pass it now or wait until after the Final Four?’ ” Mr. Zeigler said. “The timing of it could not have been more beneficial to us. If they had waited another month, this wouldn’t have gotten the attention that it deserves.”
The sports world played a pivotal role this week in applying pressure to the Indiana legislators. The Final Four head coaches combined on a statement that said discrimination should not be tolerated. University of Southern California athletic director Pat Haden said he would not be attending the weekend festivities because his son is gay and he is proud of him. The University of Connecticut barred its coaching staff from attending the NABC Conference. NASCAR also said it did not agree with the religious freedom act.
The NCAA, which moved to Indianapolis in 1999, made a statement earlier this week when president Mark Emmert said Indian’s religious freedom act was against what his organization stands for and said he was open to moving events out of the city if a change wasn’t made. On Thursday, Mr. Emmert said in a statement that he was pleased with the proposed revisions.
Certainly, in this sports-crazy state, the pressure was on.
“The sports world,” Mr. Zeigler said, “has power, social power, that Apple, or IBM, or some of those other companies just don’t have.”
This week, Arkansas legislators passed a law similar to Indiana’s. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson did not sign it, a clear sign that the nation has been watching the backlash. That state on Thursday also passed a revised law which, Gov. Hutchinson said, recognizes that Arkansas has “a diverse workforce and a diverse culture.”
Here in Indiana, fueled by a trying yet educational week, the discussion of LGBT rights will only intensify in the coming months and years.
“I don’t see this issue going away anytime soon,” said Chris Morehead, the president of Indy Pride, “not until the LGBT community is included as a protected class in the state of Indiana.”
