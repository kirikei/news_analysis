DEWITT TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — The Transportation Security Administration is making it easier for travelers to pass through security screening at Lansing's airport.
The Lansing State Journal ( http://on.lsj.com/1H170CN ) reports the federal agency has brought its pre-check program at Capital Regional Airport in DeWitt Township. The program is offered at more than 130 airports, including Detroit, Flint Grand Rapids and MBS International Airport in Freeland.
The pre-check program speeds up screening for pre-approved passengers, allowing them to pass through metal detectors without removing shoes, belts and jackets, or unpacking laptops and liquids while going through security checkpoints.
Eligible passengers must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Children 12 and younger also qualify when traveling with an eligible passenger.
