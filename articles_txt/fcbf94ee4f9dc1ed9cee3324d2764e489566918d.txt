MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) Â— Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley says he will veto any state budget that includes the "draconian" cuts that would be required without tax increases.
Bentley in a speech on Friday continued to press for public support for his $541 million tax proposal for lawmakers. He says the need is actually much higher.
The $1.8 billion general fund is expected to have a roughly $290 million shortfall next year. Bentley says everyone will be affected by general fund budget cuts.
A draft budget outlines deep cuts of between 11 and 16 percent for most state agencies.
Lawmakers haven't embraced Bentley's tax proposal during the first third of the legislative session.
Bentley says he won't fight a new bill to create an Alabama lottery but says it's not a solution for the state.
