When Twitter released its Periscope live video streaming app back in March, it was an iOS-only affair. Now you can use it on Android devices as well.
Only users running Android 4.4 or above can run the app, which includes a few additional features not available in the iOS version. You can customise push notifications more precisely and automatic replay being available without the original broadcaster having to upload a file.
