Four advertisers and counting are pulling their advertising dollars from TLC's 19 Kids and Counting following the recent confession by star Josh Duggar that he molested underage girls, The Hollywood Reporter reported.
Payless ShoeSource, Choice Hotels, General Mills and Walgreens have all backed out from sponsoring the show in light of the scandal.
"In the wake of recent news, we are no longer advertising on the 19 Kids and Counting program," a spokesperson for Walgreens told THR.
Josh Duggar, 27, is the eldest of the Duggar children and admitted Thursday that he sexually assaulted young girls, including his own sisters, over a decade ago.
"Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret," Josh said in a statement. "I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation. We spoke with authorities where I confessed my wrongdoing, and my parents arranged for me and those affected by my actions to receive counseling. I understood that if I continued down this wrong road that I would end up ruining my life."
