MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Gov. Scott Walker has signed a bill that will allow state judges to issue restraining orders against anyone who uses technology to harass a Wisconsin resident from anywhere in the country.
Current state law allows Wisconsin judges to issue restraining orders only against harassers and stalkers who reside within the state.
Walker signed the bill into law on Wednesday. The bill's authors, Sen. Van Wangaard, a Republican from Racine, and Rep. Amy Loudenback, a Republican from Clinton, issued a statement saying the law would provide Wisconsin residents additional protection against cyberbullying and harassment.
