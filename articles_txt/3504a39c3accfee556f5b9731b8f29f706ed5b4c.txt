ST. LOUIS (KMOX) – The Supreme Court denies a death sentence appeal for a North St. Louis County man who is set to die by lethal injection next week.
Death row inmate Andre Cole threatened to kill his ex-wife when he faced garnishment for back child support in 1998.
Within hours of the first deduction from his paycheck, he broke into her home in the 10100 block of Castle Drive in North County, then stabbed her and a man inside several times.
The man who was visiting , Anthony Curtis, died. Cole’s ex-wife, Terri, survived the attack.
The Missouri Supreme Court has issued a 4-3 decision upholding the death sentence.
Cole’s attorneys argued he was mentally incompetent to die by lethal injection.
Federal law prohibits prisoners from being executed if they cannot comprehend the punishment. The Supreme Court says that is not the case with Andre Cole.
“Considering all the evidence presented, he has failed to show he is incompetent to be executed,” according to the state’s high court. “Judge Laura Denvir Stith dissents. She would hold that the man has made a substantial threshold showing of incompetence, entitling him to a stay of execution and a fair hearing to determine whether the man’s current mental capacity bars his execution.”
His execution is scheduled for April 14.
