SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) â€” 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has apologized for a post on social media Tuesday that referenced flood-ravaged Houston, where San Francisco opens the preseason Aug. 15.
Kaepernick had posted on Twitter and Instagram earlier Tuesday a photo of submerged cars and this message: "I warned you the #7torms Coming !!! #Houston. Kaepernick's jersey number is 7.
Houston and Central Texas are dealing with a severe storm that included 11 inches of rain overnight.
Kaepernick later made a follow-up post reading, "No disrespect intended! Prayers up!" before issuing a statement.
He wrote: "I'm so sorry about my insensitive post earlier today. I didn't fully understand how many people are struggling in Houston right now and I feel horrible. My prayers are with everyone there."
Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson offered his support.
