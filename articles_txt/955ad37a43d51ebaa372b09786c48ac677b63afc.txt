Alabama Governor Robert Bentley says Alabama will face severe cuts in state services if legislators refuse to raise taxes.  The governor described the potential budget cuts during a speech Wednesday.  Bentley says Alabama could see the closure of state parks, reductions in mental health services, longer courthouse lines, a possible release of state inmates and other consequences.  So far, lawmakers have shown little excitement for Bentley's proposed $541 million tax package.  Bentley says politicians need to look at "what is best for this state."  The governor said he is willing to bring lawmakers back into session multiple times until they approve a reasonable General Fund budget.  
Strong Storms
Forecasters say strong to severe storms are expected across northern Alabama as a cold front approaches the state.  The National Weather Service in Huntsville says the storms are expected to develop along and ahead of the front, which will move through the region late Thursday and into Friday.
