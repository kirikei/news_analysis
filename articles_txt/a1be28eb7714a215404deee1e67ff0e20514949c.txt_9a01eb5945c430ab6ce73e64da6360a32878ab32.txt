The couple became engaged in March, launching whirlwind plans to get married this month.
Sgt. Dakota Meyer and Bristol Palin called off their wedding just days before they were slated to tie the knot in Kentucky on Saturday.
Bristol Palin has broken her silence, addressing her called-off wedding to U.S. Marine and war hero Sgt. Dakota Meyer for the first time.
"Sorry it's taken me so long to talk about this... It's been hard," the 24-year-old began in a Facebook post Tuesday that linked to a statement on her blog.
There, in a post titled "The Wedding That Didn't Happen," she spoke of her broken engagement to the Medal of Honor recipient — as well as an apparent broken heart.
"I guess you have seen by now that the wedding — that was supposed to happen last weekend — was called off," she stated.

In a blog post, the 24-year-old single mother said that she and her young son, pictured here with Meyer, are working to rebuild their lives 'under much different circumstances.'
The single mother, who publicly announced her engagement to Meyer just in March, went on to ask for prayers during "a painful time for family and friends."
"I know God's plan is greater than anything else, and Tripp and I are in Alaska beginning to rebuild our lives under much different circumstances than we anticipated," she stated while mentioning her 6-year-old son whose father, Levi Johnston, she was twice engaged to.
Why Saturday's wedding was called off remains publicly unaddressed by both the Palins and Meyer.

Curiously the news, announced by her mother Sarah Palin on Facebook last week, came just days after documents emerged showing that Meyer previously wed a Michigan woman in 2008 at the age of 19 in Kentucky.
Bristol Palin claimed that she knew about this prior marriage and insisted that Meyer and the woman divorced "years ago." A public records search by the Daily News recovered no trace of divorce papers containing Meyer's name in Kentucky or Michigan.
On Saturday close friends and family still gathered in Kentucky where the young couple's nuptials were planned.
Instead of celebrating a wedding, however, Sarah Palin said they'd "celebrate life, in general!"

Bristol Palin breaks silence on canceling her wedding to Dakota Meyer
Bristol Palin is breaking her silence on calling off her wedding to fiancé, Dakota Meyer, which was supposed to take place this past weekend.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, confirmed the wedding was off in a lengthy Facebook post last week but did say the two families were still getting together for a party on the day the wedding was scheduled.
"I guess you have seen by now that the wedding — that was supposed to happen last weekend — was called off," she wrote on her blog . "I'm sure you've seen this has been all over the media, but this is a painful time for family and friends and I would just really appreciate your prayers."
Palin, 24, added, "I know God's plan is greater than anything else, and Tripp and I are in Alaska beginning to rebuild our lives under much different circumstances than we anticipated. Thank you for all of your love and support."
She never gets specific about why the wedding was canceled, though she did previously shoot down rumors it was because Meyer was still legally married to his first wife.
