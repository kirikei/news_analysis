MONTPELIER, Vt.
A spokesman for Sen. Bernie Sanders says the Vermont Independent will decide by the end of the month whether to enter the 2016 White House race.
In the meantime, he's urging newly announced presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to speak out strongly about wealth inequality and climate change.
Sanders, who describes himself as a "democratic socialist," has been drawing large crowds as he travels the country speaking on those issues and others.
Sanders also is urging Clinton to speak out against the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which Sanders says has unleashed a torrent of money from big donors to political candidates.
Sanders initially had said he would announce his own plans by March, but has been tied up in budget talks as ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.
