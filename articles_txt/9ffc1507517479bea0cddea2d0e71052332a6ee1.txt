A new study from the British Association of Dermatologists concluded sunscreen causes skin cancer.
It said skin cancer is caused by two types of ultraviolet light from the sun: UVA and UVB rays. The study states most sunscreens do not protect against both types of rays.
Dr. Craig Kraffert, a Redding dermatologist disagrees.
"We're in a situation where people are saying sunscreen could cause skin cancer," said Dr. Kraffert. "But nothing could be further from the truth."
Kraffert, a creator of a sunscreen line himself, said sunscreens marked 'broad spectrum' can protect people from skin cancer.Â 
"Sunscreens, ideally, should block both UVA and UVB to be considered broad spectrum."
He added broad spectrum sunscreens should be SPF 30 or higher and be labeled "water resistant." He said this is the best product to protect skin against harmful rays. He also stressed anything over SPF 75 is not regulated by the FDA and does not necessarily mean more protection.
Not all sunscreens are broad spectrum. Checking the label is crucial to finding the right one.
"The problem is making elegant sunscreens that are broad spectrum protection and water resistant is very expensive," added Dr. Kraffert. "Coppertone is a respected and good brand."
He added skin cancer is hardest to treat on the lips, nose and eyelids. Sunscreen should be worn on any part of the body not covered by clothes. Lip balm with SPF should be applied and a hat should be worn in the sun, according to Dr. Kraffert.
