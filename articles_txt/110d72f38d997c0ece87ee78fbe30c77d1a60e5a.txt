SPRINGFIELD, Illinois — A special ceremony will be held in Springfield next week to mark the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's death.
Officials from the state's Historic Preservation Agency say the April 15th event outside the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum will include a flag presentation by sailors from the USS Abraham Lincoln, a fly-over by Navy Jets, remarks by Gov. Bruce Rauner and appearances by humorist Tom Dreesen and Chicago Blackhawks anthem singer Jim Cornelison.
The free event also includes an appearance by a Tuskegee airman, military band music and a 21-gun salute.
The event is one of several hosted by the Lincoln Presidential Library to mark Lincoln's death and funeral, and the anniversary of the Civil War's end.
