Half of Seattle medical dispensaries may be shut down as city combines marijuana markets

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said Tuesday that about half of all medical marijuana facilities within city limits will shut down before July 2016.
Thatâs because his office, endorsed by City Attorney Pete Holmes and City Councilmember Nick Licata, moved forward legislation Tuesday to overhaul Seattleâs medical marijuana regulations and incorporate them into the recreational marijuana market.
The legislation now moves to Seattle City Council where Licata is confident it will pass.

Murray's guess is unscientific â he said it's hard to understand the breadth of the medical marijuana market until it is fully legal. Because the medical marijuana shops are operating basically without regulations, they are difficult to track.
The new rules also don't necessarily mean that there will be fewer places where patients can buy medical marijuana. What it does mean is that illegitimate medical marijuana dispensaries will be shut down, Murray said.
âThis time next year, there will be more legal marijuana dispensaries than exist now,â Murray said at a press conference Tuesday.
Marijuana businesses that operate within the city of Seattle will be required to get an additional license from the city, after theyâve received a license from the Washington State Liquor Control Board, which is soon to be renamed the Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board.
Both recreational and medical shops will be required to get the city's Title 6 license.
Before the legislation was introduced, the medical shops were operating illegally anyway under city rules. The new rules will give them a way to come into compliance. Once the legislation passes there will be no legal framework that medical marijuana shops can operate under in the city of Seattle. All marijuana shops in the city will have Title 6 licenses or be shut down.
The cityâs legislation is piggybacking on Senate Bill 5052, which was passed by the Washington state Legislature earlier this year. It provided a framework for medical marijuana that aligns with the 502 legislation.
In Seattle, there are 14 open recreational marijuana shops. There are 99 medical marijuana storefronts.
Medical marijuana dispensaries can continue to operate in the city if they are eligible or working toward a 502 license until July 2016.
The biggest issue is that many of the city's medical marijuana dispensaries arenât legit.
âTrue medical operators are being buried [by illegitimate ones],â said Jeremy Kauffman, director of the Center for Palliative Care.
The intent of the law is to provide safe, consistent and quality access to patients throughout Seattle.
Medical dispensaries that opened too recently (after Jan. 1, 2013), that did not obtain a basic business license from the city, pay taxes or were found to have sold to non-medical marijuana patients will be closed down as soon as the legislation goes into effect.
