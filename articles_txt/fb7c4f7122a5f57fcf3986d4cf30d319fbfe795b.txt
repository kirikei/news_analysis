Johnny Depp could face up to 10 years in an Australian prison after allegedly bringing his two dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country without the proper clearance, according to the Sydney Morning Herald .
According to the report, the case was discussed at a recent Senate committee hearing, during which it was clarified that the actor could face prison time or a maximum $340,000 fine for smuggling his canine companions on his private jet and not putting them in quarantine for 10 days upon arrival, as required by Australian law. His pilot could likewise face two years in prison for failing to acknowledge the presence of the two dogs aboard the aircraft.
The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce threatened to put down Depp's Yorkshire terriers upon discovering they were illegally brought into the country on April 21, when the actor returned to Australia to continue filming the latest installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Dead Men Tell No Tales. 
The two dogs were first discovered by authorities when photos of them at a grooming salon began circulating on social media, and they have since been safely evacuated to the U.S.
The Agriculture Department is currently still investigating and no charges have been filed.
