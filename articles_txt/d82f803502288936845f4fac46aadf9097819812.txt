HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - The top aide to Pennsylvania’s attorney general is leaving after just four months on the job to join a Philadelphia law firm.
Blake Rutherford told agency employees Friday that it was his last day as chief of staff to Attorney General Kathleen Kane.
Rutherford starts work next month at Cozen O’Connor and the law firm’s governmental relations operation.
The announcement comes three days after the state Supreme Court upheld the appointment of a special prosecutor who led a grand jury investigation into the leak of secret material to a newspaper.
The grand jury has recommended Kane be charged with perjury and other offenses, but any decision about charges is now in the hands of a suburban Philadelphia district attorney.
Kane has maintained she did not break any law.
