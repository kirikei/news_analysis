Fact check: How can the GST on tampons be scrapped?
Updated 27 May 2015, 15:55 AEST
The states and territories are poised to consider a change to the GST when they next meet in July.
Fifteen years after it was introduced, the issue of what's included in the GST is once again the subject of hot debate.
One young woman has started an online petition that calls on the Government to scrap the GST on tampons and other sanitary products. According to the petition, over 95,000 people support the proposal.
But both Treasurer Joe Hockey and Prime Minister Tony Abbott say that changing how the GST is applied is a matter for the states and territories.
The verdict
ABC Fact Check has considered this issue previously , and found that there's no legal barrier to the federal government changing the base or rate of the GST without state and territory permission.
While it might be politically difficult, and not something any government would do lightly, claims from Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott that it's not possible to change the GST without state agreement are misleading.
