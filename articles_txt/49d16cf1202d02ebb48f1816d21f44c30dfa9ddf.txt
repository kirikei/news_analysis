JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - A Missouri Republican lawmaker is trying to tax marijuana and illegal drugs.
A proposal to require a tax stamp for drugs advanced in the Legislature last week. A vote of approval from a second House panel is needed before the bill can go before the full chamber for debate.
The National Conference of State Legislatures reports at least 20 other states now tax drugs.
For example, Nebraska taxes marijuana at $100 an ounce. Dealers face additional fees if caught selling without a tax stamp.
Last year, the NCSL reported Nebraska has collected at least $544,588 in fines since adopting the tax in 1991.
Missourians could anonymously purchase tax stamps under Republican Rep. Shawn Rhoads' proposal. The bill would not legalize possession of marijuana or other drugs.
