A snapshot of a young cancer patient has gone viral after the girl's mother posted the picture on Facebook.
Maliyah Jones is just 5 years old but as already been battling neuroblastoma for nearly three years, according to a Facebook page run by her mother, Tazz Jones.
Earlier this year, Jones snapped a picture of her daughter with another young cancer patient as they looked out on the Pittsburgh skyline, reportedly at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Jones told WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh that Maliyah had met her new friend that day and was just excited to hang out.
"We just met that day. Maliyah ran up to her," Jones told WPXI-TV. "They were hugging and looking out the window and I asked, 'Can I take a picture of them.' And I took the picture and that was it."
Jones said on Facebook that Maliyah is now getting further treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, after having a relapse this year.
Jones, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
