In his message, Mr Cameron said: “Across Britain, Christians don’t just talk about ‘loving thy neighbour’, they live it out… in faith schools, in prisons, in community groups.
 
 “Yes, we are a nation that embraces, welcomes and accepts all faiths and none but we are still a Christian country. And as a Christian country, Our responsibilities don’t end there.
"We have a duty to speak out about the persecution of Christians around the world too.
 
Cameron, 49, is the political leader of the Tories and has been prime minister since 2010. His words were spoken two days before President Obama addressed the Easter Prayer Breakfast at the White House.
In contrast to Cameron, Obama took aim at his Christian political opponents, suggesting they have been spiteful and rude: "On Easter, I do reflect on the fact that as a Christian, I am supposed to love. And I have to say that sometimes when I listen to less than loving expressions by Christians, I get concerned. But that's a topic for another day," he said.
 
Where there is injustice — I was about to veer off. I'm pulling it back. Where there is injustice we defend the oppressed. Where there is disagreement, we treat each other with compassion and respect. Where there are differences, we find strength in our common humanity, knowing that we are all children of God. 
So today, we celebrate the magnificent glory of our risen Savior. I pray that we will live up to His example. I pray that I will live up to His example. I fall short so often. Every day I try to do better. I pray that we will be strengthened by His eternal love. I pray that we will be worthy of His many blessings.
For conservatives, Cameron’s speech showed that Obama is more critical than affirming of Christianity. Obama mentioned what he regarded as the historical failings of Christians during his speech at the National Prayer Breakfast in February.
 
Among the Catholic participants spotted in the room were Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, Sister Carol Keehan, a Daughter of Charity who is president and CEO of the Catholic Health Association, Mgr Ronald Jenkins, general secretary of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Jesuit Fr Tom Reese, a columnist for the National Catholic Reporter, and White House staffers that included Chief of Staff Denis McDonough.
But Obama's words and invitees are unlikely to mollify his religioious critics.
