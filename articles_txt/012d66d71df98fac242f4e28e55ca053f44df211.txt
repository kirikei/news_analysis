Jason Rezaian, an Iranian-American correspondent for the Washington Post, has been detained in Iran for over eight months and is accused of "espionage," according to a news agency in Iran.
TEHRAN — A Washington Post journalist detained in Iran for more than eight months is accused of “espionage” and “acting against national security,” the semi-official Fars news agency reported Sunday.
The report did not elaborate on the source of the information, but the agency is regarded as close to Iran’s hard-liners.
Iranian officials have previously said Jason Rezaian is facing “security” charges and that he will stand trial before the Revolutionary Court — which mainly hears sensitive cases involving national security.
Rezaian’s lawyer Leila Ahsan declined to comment on the specific charges against her client, but told The Associated Press she had finished studying the text of the indictment and would brief Rezaian’s family in the coming days.
Rezaian, along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and two photojournalists were detained on July 22 in Tehran. All were later released except Rezaian, who is a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen. Iran does not recognize dual nationality.
