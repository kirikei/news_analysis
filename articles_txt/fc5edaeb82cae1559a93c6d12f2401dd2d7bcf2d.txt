CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin has vetoed 32 bills passed by the Republican-led Legislature, the most by a West Virginia governor in decades.
The Democrat finished deciding Friday on bills that passed during the 60-day legislative session. The vetoes killed bills letting people carry concealed handguns without permits, drink raw milk and write checks to the state to fill potholes outside their businesses.
Tomblin nixed 17 bills because he disagreed with their policies. The other 15 were due to technical errors, including a bill that gave authority to a board that hasn't existed in 15 years.
Lawmakers re-passed 12 of those bills before leaving town. The rest are dead until next year.
Tomblin still found middle ground with lawmakers. He signed 243 bills, from legal reforms to help for craft brewers.
