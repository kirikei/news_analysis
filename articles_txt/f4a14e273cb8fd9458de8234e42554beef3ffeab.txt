On the latest episode of “Real Time with Bill Maher,” the pundit and host Bill Maher  didn’t mince words when giving his take on Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) recently signed into law by Governor Mike Pence.
Maher expanded beyond the national debate over the role of RFRA, with a comparison between fundamentalist Muslims in the Middle East and fundamentalist Christians in the U.S.:
“Suffice it to say, in many Muslim countries, you wouldn’t have to work hard at all to get signatures on your ‘kill all the gays’ ballot initiative. In ten such countries, it’s already the law.
People say ISIS hijacked Islam. No actually, the opposite is true. Religions do have hijackers, but the hijackers are the moderates, and I thank atheist God for them.
They’re the ones who took a Sharpie to the Bible and redacted all the crazy parts until there was almost nothing left to read – like an email from Hillary Clinton. And now someone in Islam needs to do that with the Koran.”
Maher’s ‘kill all gays’ statement referenced Matt McLaughlin, a lawyer  who proposed a much maligned and controversial initiative for California’s ballot called the ‘Sodomite Suppression Act,’ a bill that seeks to legalize execution for homosexuality.
As far as the Indiana law, however, Maher focused his ire on conservative Christians and their beliefs:
“Ever since Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed his Religious Freedom Restoration Act he and like-minded conservatives have been trying to have it both ways. They hate discrimination, but they love the Bible, a book that commands you to discriminate.
That’s what it says. Gay is an abomination and we must destroy it by denying it pastry.
Of course the root of this problem is that more than half of all Americans believe that the Bible is the actual or inspired word of God. But, now 55 percent also support gay marriage – which must be very confusing.
On the one hand, clearly, God has spelled it out. He hates fags. But, you like your gay neighbors Rob and Larry. But, the Bible tells you to kill them. Yes, it literally says kill them. What to do?”
Breitbart recently created a list of reactions on the “anti-gay” RFRA from other celebrity personalities with similarly charged language  against those who support the law.
