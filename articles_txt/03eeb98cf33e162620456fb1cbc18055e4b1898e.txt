ST. LOUIS (AP) — The Missouri Supreme Court has vacated an execution order for a former St. Louis jailer convicted of his ex-wife's 2000 murder-for-hire death.
The high court announced Wednesday it was withdrawing its order from last month that scheduled 51-year-old Kimber Edwards to be put to death May 12.
The court didn't explain its decision. But Edwards' attorneys had told the court the May execution date conflicted with the timing of other court cases they're handling and didn't give them enough time to complete a clemency request on Edwards' behalf.
Edwards was convicted of hiring Orthell Wilson to kill 35-year-old Kimberly Cantrell in her suburban St. Louis apartment. Prosecutors said Edwards wanted Cantrell dead to avoid paying child support.
Wilson pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.
