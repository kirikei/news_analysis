The French Open 2015 live stream and TV schedule brings Day 4 on Wednesday as the top men’s and women’s players continue to compete. Two of the favorites for each draw will be in action including Roger Federer and the 2015 reigning champion, Maria Sharapova. They’ll look to continue their push towards another French Open title, as live streaming online and televised tennis coverage continues from ESPN networks.
According to USA Today in a May 25 report, Maria Sharapova was able to defeat her first round opponent Kaia Kanepi 6-2, 6-4 on the Phillipe Chartier Court. However, the two-time French Open champion received a chorus of boos when she refused to do a post-match interview for the fans inside the main court. Sharapova is reportedly fighting a cold and was said to have a “broken” voice according to the stadium emcee. The winner at Roland Garros in 2012 and just last year will next face fellow Russian Vitalia Diatchenko for the second round.
Meanwhile, the men’s No. 2 Roger Federer also had his own recent incident involving a fan at the tournament. The Swiss star won 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 against Alejandro Falla for the opening round just a few days ago. However, an ambitious fan stormed the court after the match looking for a selfie with his favorite tennis player. Security eventually ushered the young man off the court and reportedly there were no repercussions against the fan. Federer faces Spanish player Marcel Granollers for the second round on Wednesday.
In terms of the odds for the men’s and women’s No. 2 seeds, both are heavy favorites. Sharapova is priced at around -3300 on the moneyline, compared to +1400 for her opponent. Federer is a larger favorite at -5000, while his opponent is a +1600 underdog. Federer was listed fourth in terms of favorites to win the men’s championship, behind Murray, Nadal and Djokovic. Sharapova, the 2014 defending champion, was listed second behind No. 1 women’s player Serena Williams.
Wednesday’s French Open 2015 live streaming and televised coverage is scheduled for a 5 a.m. EST start in the United States. Viewers can watch it live on TV via ESPN2 on cable and satellite around the nation. In addition, there’s live streaming online coverage available through the ESPN3/WatchESPN broadband sports network. Live audio commentary is available for Sirius XM satellite radio subscribers on channels 93, XM 208, or internet channel 965 through the tournament.
