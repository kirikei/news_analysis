OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Oklahoma drivers could be pulled over and ticketed for texting while driving under a bill passed overwhelmingly in the state Senate.
The Senate voted 38-6 on Wednesday for the bill, which now returns to the House for consideration.
The bill makes it illegal for a driver to use a mobile phone to “compose, send or read an electronic text message” while the vehicle is in motion. Violators face a fine of up to $100.
The Senate narrowly approved an amendment to make texting while driving a primary offense - meaning an officer can stop over a motorist if they spot them using a mobile phone.
The bill was named for two state troopers who were struck by a motorist who authorities say was distracted by his phone.
