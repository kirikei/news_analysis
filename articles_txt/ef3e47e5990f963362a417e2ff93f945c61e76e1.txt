Former HP CEO calls Apple CEO Tim Cook a hypocrite on gay rights
New Delhi: Apple CEO Tim Cook is the latest to bear the criticism of potential 2016 presidential candidate, Carly Fiorina, who has called the tech giant's boss a hypocrite on gay rights.
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard said that Cook was guilty of "a level of hypocrisy here that really is unfortunate" for criticizing Indiana and Arkansas over their Religious Freedom Restoration Acts while at the same time doing business in countries where gay rights are non-existent.
She argued that when Tim Cook is upset about all the places that he does business because of the way they treat gays and women, he needs to withdraw from 90 per cent of the markets that he's in, including China and Saudi Arabia.
Former HP CEO Carly Fiorina says that Tim Cook gets upsets about places he does business because they don't treat well gays and women, but he doesn't withdraw from those markets to support the cause.
A Bloomberg report notes that Fiorina has been pointing to hypocrises around her, including the ongoing criticism of Clinton, whose hypocrisy regards foreign donations made to the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments where women's rights are not exactly on par with those in America, according to Fiorina.
They won't go to Indiana, but they will go to Saudi Arabia. http://t.co/RLvqtRdidS
