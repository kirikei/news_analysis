SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) - An attorney for the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe says Chairman Michael Jandreau (JAN'-droh) has died in Sioux Falls and vice chairman Kevin Wright says he has assumed control of the tribal government.
Attorney Marshall Matz says the 71-year old Jandreau, who was taken to Sanford Hospital one week ago, was surrounded by family when he died late Friday afternoon due to complications from pneumonia and heart disease.
Kevin Wright told The Associated Press on Friday before Jandreau's death that he was he's taking over for the good of the tribe and had all the rights of the chairman.
The 71-year-old Jandreau was chairman of the tribe for at least 30 years and was known for helping to build a robust farm economy on the reservation along the Missouri River.
He came under fire in January when Human Rights Watch issued reports outlining financial mismanagement in the Lower Brule tribe. Wright was one of the council members who criticized Jandreau the allegations, which the chairman denied.
Jandreau was born Oct. 20, 1943, in Fort Thompson on the Crow Creek reservation and was educated in American Indian schools run by the Catholic church. He had 10 children with his wife, who preceded him in death.
