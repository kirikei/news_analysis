DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The Hillary Rodham Clinton juggernaut is coming to Iowa. Martin O'Malley already has beaten her to the early-voting state.
The former Maryland governor was in a Des Moines tavern this past week, playing guitar and singing Irish folk tunes. He had a lunch with Democratic activists in the college town of Ames, and spent Friday evening talking up his populist financial message with at a celebration banquet in the capital.
For months, O'Malley has largely had Iowa to himself as Clinton slow-played her entry into the race for 2016 presidential race.
O'Malley's Iowa advantage, if there was one at all, should be coming to an end Sunday when Clinton planned to make her considerably-anticipated announcement that she's operating for the nomination for a second time. Clinton fell short in 2008 against Barack Obama.
A trip to Iowa is anticipated to follow quickly afterward.
"I assume the individuals of Iowa wake up every single morning searching toward the future, and they think inherently that we're served by new leadership," O'Malley stated Friday evening in Des Moines.
Technically, Clinton would be the first Democrat to enter the race. Other individuals, like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia and former Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, are exploring no matter whether to run.
O'Malley has accomplished the most as a potential Clinton challenger. He has reached out to Iowa for the previous three years, initial meeting with the Iowa delegation at the Democratic National Convention in 2012 before speaking at then-Sen. Tom Harkin's annual picnic fundraiser that fall.
In his final Iowa appearance just before Clinton's expected entry, O'Malley referred to as for renewing the American dream on time-tested Democratic principles.
"To make the dream come accurate again, we should fight for superior wages for all workers, so that Americans can support their households on what they earn," O'Malley stated at a party dinner Friday evening in Des Moines.
For the most element, he has steered clear of publicly criticizing Clinton. He has focused on the lengthy, disciplined march of a serious candidate who knows he is an underdog.
O'Malley has visited Iowa six occasions since the start off of last year. He put 14 staffers to perform on Iowa campaigns for the duration of last year's election and has hired one particular for his possible campaign.
"The wonderful point about Iowa and New Hampshire is that people today insist on meeting all of the candidates before they make a selection," O'Malley mentioned.
That is not just O'Malley's line, either.
Even with Clinton in the race, a lot of of the party loyalists who will brave a winter evening in Iowa in February to select a candidate at caucus web pages say they want a contest, not a coronation.
"I'm going to see what they all have to say," mentioned Geri Frederiksen of Council Bluffs. He waited three hours on Thursday to see a flight-delayed Webb at the western Iowa city's public library.
Both Frederiksen and her pal, Dolores Bristol, stated they are worried that a perfunctory nominating contest could possibly not stir adequate enthusiasm amongst Iowa Democrats to energy a victory for the at some point nominee in November 2016.
Iowa is anticipated to be among the most contested states in the general election.
"Clinton appears like she's the 1. Do I have the fervor for her that I did for Obama? No," Bristol mentioned. "But O'Malley is quite charismatic, and much more progressive, which a lot of Iowa Democrats like."
Surveys of voters this far ahead of the February caucuses have limited value, but Clinton did lead by far more than 50 percentage points in a recent Iowa Poll. Both Webb and O'Malley were rated the first option of three percent and 1 percent of voters, respectively, in a poll with a margin of error of four.9 percentage points.
But Clinton had a massive lead in 2007, also, before she was upset by then-Illinois Sen. Obama in the 2008 caucuses.
O'Malley is maintaining up a schedule of meetings with state lawmakers, lunches with activists and city officials and speeches at fundraisers such as the one particular he headlined Thursday at a winery in the scenic hills south of Des Moines.
About 50 folks heard O'Malley promote his Maryland record and preview of his probably 2016 message: executive expertise, combined with progressive economic policies such as raising the minimum wage, taxing the wealthy and regulating banks.
"We do it by asking the wealthiest among us to essentially think enough in their country to make the sort of investments we produced in other generations, instead of offshoring their profits and offshoring their wealth," O'Malley said.
So far, Webb has not spent as a great deal time in Iowa as O'Malley. That may well be why, after delivering a talk that focused on social justice and a bipartisan foreign policy on Thursday to an audience of only a dozen or so, he got asked directly if he has any type of shot against Clinton.
"Are you a viable candidate?" said Democrat Jamie Lakers, who drove two hours from Des Moines to see Webb at the library in Council Bluffs. "Because from the news media, Hillary Clinton's currently been elected."
Webb wondered aloud if he was.
