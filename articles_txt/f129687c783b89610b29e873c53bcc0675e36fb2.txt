King later died in a Memphis hospital.
In Atlanta, mayor Ivan Allen, Jr. saw a television news flash telling of King’s shooting and called Coretta Scott King to express his sympathy and ask if there was anything he could do. At the time, King was still alive, so she asked Allen to help her get to the airport to catch a plane to Memphis. Allen arranged a police escort and he and his wife accompanied her to the airport. Upon arriving, they received the news that King had just died. 
In Georgia, longtime King foe Gov. Lester Maddox had no public comment and refused to take reporters’ questions. However Georgia born singer James Brown went on national television to appeal for restraint but none the less rioting broke out in more than 100 cities across America, resulting in the deaths of 46 people. Heavy rain falling in Atlanta that night helped spare the city from the violent demonstrations experienced elsewhere. 
Two months later James Earl Ray was captured in London. British officials returned him to Tennessee, where he initially confessed to the crime.
