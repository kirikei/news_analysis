WASHINGTON (April 8, 2015) Some teenagers get driving lessons from their parents while others are taught by licensed instructors, but Malia Obama’s driving lessons were provided by the U.S. Secret Service.
That's what Malia's mother, Michelle Obama, told celebrity chef and daytime talk-show host Rachael Ray in an interview scheduled to air Thursday.
Mrs. Obama says she hasn't driven herself in seven or eight years and that the armed agents who protect her family refused to let her in the car with her 16-year-old daughter.
The first lady adds that driving gives Malia a "sense of normalcy," like the rest of her friends who are driving.
Mrs. Obama says her children, including younger daughter Sasha, have to learn how to live like normal kids.
