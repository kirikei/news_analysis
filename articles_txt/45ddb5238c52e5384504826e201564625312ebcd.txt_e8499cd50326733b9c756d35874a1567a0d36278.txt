Hawaii Gov. David Ige said Tuesday that he supports the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter… more
Hawaii Gov. David Ige gave his official support for the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope project Tuesday, and asked that the University of Hawaii return to the authority of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources more than 10,000 acres of the Mauna Kea summit on the Big Island not being used for astronomy.
The planned observatory took the âappropriate steps and received the approvals needed to move forward,â Ige said, noting that the state will support and enforce TMT Observatory Corp.âs right to proceed.
To âbring cultural voices into the leadership structure,â the state will form the Mauna Kea Cultural Council to advise the Board of Land and Natural Resources and DLNR.
The university, which will keep jurisdiction of the 525-acre area used for astronomy, must decommission a quarter of all existing telescopes by the time TMT is ready for operation in the 2020s, Ige said. The university holds a lease on the land until 2033.
Construction on the $1.4 billion internationally backed project remains at a standstill , but technological infrastructure is underway, according to Michael Bolte , a member of the TMT International Observatory board.
âWhile TMT has not yet determined a construction restart timeline, tremendous work in other areas of the project continues,â he told PBN in an email. âSoftware development, building of mirrors and other technology advancements are being done by TMT partners in Canada, China, Japan, India and the United States.â
UH President David Lassner , meanwhile, thanked Ige for his commitment to Mauna Kea.
âWe agree that the university can and must do better, and we apologize for where our efforts to date have fallen short,â he said in a statement. âThe specific actions the governor requested today are fully consistent with what we have heard in public testimony, discussions and meetings with numerous community members and stakeholders. We will issue a more comprehensive statement within the week that will describe how we will implement these steps moving forward.â
