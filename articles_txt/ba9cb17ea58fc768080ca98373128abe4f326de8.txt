The State Senate unanimously approved a bill that establishes a wrongful convictions commission. The vote happened years after Houston democratic Senator Rodney Ellis first tried passing the legislation. The 11-person commission would examine exoneration cases since 2010 to "see what went wrong." The group would make recommendations to avoid repeating the mistake.
The commission is named for Timothy Cole. Cole was a Texas Tech undergraduate student who died in prison after being wrongfully convicted of rape. The conviction was overturned ten years after his death, Cole was the first Texas to be posthumously pardoned in 2010 by former Governor Perry.
The house approved a similar bill. Both version may go to conference committee.
Texas exonerated 39 people in 2014, the most in the country.
