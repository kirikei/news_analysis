David Cameron has already begun a charm offensive across Europe
In the UK, plans for an in/out referendum on the European Union are expected to be included in the address from Queen Elizabeth II to the British parliament.
The speech will set out the plans of the Conservative government for the coming parliamentary term. 
Among the measures to be announced in the speech will be the proposed In/Out referendum on European membership.
The Queen's speech marks the formal opening of the British parliament.
The speech itself will have been written by the Conservative party setting out the political agenda it intends to follow in the coming term as government.
It will be the first time in almost 20 years that that speech will have set out the plans of a majority Conservative government. 
That majority - although slim - allows it to enact some of the policies promised in the party's election manifesto.
Primary among those will be the promised in/out referendum on Europe. 
Prime Minister David Cameron has already begun a charm offensive across Europe as he battles for reform of the EU that would allow him to support the UK staying within the union.
Those early moves suggest the referendum itself might take place sooner rather than later - possibly by the middle of next year.
