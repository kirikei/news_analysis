New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's job favorability and performance ratings have hit an all time low in his five years in office.
This according to a new Siena Poll. Cuomo's favorability rating is 53% -44%, which is down from 63%-31% in June of 2014.
The poll's findings also show that while voters say corruption in state government is a large problem, they're more concerned with addressing jobs and education issues.
57% of voters say that the level of corruption in state government over the last four years is about the same as it was previously.
