Abdullah al-Thani, who heads Libya's Tobruk-based government, survived an assassination attempt in eastern Libya on Tuesday.
"Unidentified gunmen attacked al-Thinni's motorcade as he was en route to the eastern Al-Bayda city," Interior Ministry spokesman Tareq al-Kharraz told Anadolu Agency.
"Al-Thani emerged unhurt in the attack," he said.
According to the spokesman, one of al-Thani's companions was injured in the attack.
Earlier Tuesday, the Tobruk-based parliament failed to meet over protests demanding the resignation of al-Thani's government.
Since then, the country's stark political divisions have yielded two rival seats of government, each with its own institutions and military capacities.
Vying for legislative authority are the Tobruk-based House of Representatives and the Islamist-led General National Congress, which convenes in capital Tripoli.
The two assemblies support two rival governments respectively headquartered in the two cities.
