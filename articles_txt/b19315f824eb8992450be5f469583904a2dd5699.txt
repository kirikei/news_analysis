TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — A member of Congress from Michigan says he'll offer a resolution opposing a Canadian plan to store nuclear waste underground less than a mile from Lake Huron.
U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee announced his plan Friday. The Democrat's office says seven other representatives from both parties have signed on as co-sponsors.
Publicly owned Ontario Power Generation is seeking permission from the Canadian government to entomb waste from its nuclear power plants 2,230 feet below the surface at a site near Kincardine, Ontario.
The company says the low- and intermediate-level waste would be so deep that there's no chance it would contaminate Lake Huron.
But opponents say the risk is too great. Kildee's resolution calls on the Canadian government to find an alternative location for the waste.
