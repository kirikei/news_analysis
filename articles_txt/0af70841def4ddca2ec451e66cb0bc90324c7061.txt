The much sought-after Twitter-owned live streaming app, Periscope has finally arrived on Android Google Play store, two months after first arriving for iPhone.
Periscope which first appeared on iOS early this year has since been eagerly awaited by android users to appear on their mobile devices.
Periscope enables users to conveniently livestream video content directly from a mobile device. The app has found a widespread user base as the journalists and experts have been using it to do video chats while people at big events like political rallies or sporting events are utilizing the app to air the happenings on the event location.
The features of the new app on Android will be quite similar to those available on the iOS version but certain perks have been promised to the Android users. A ‘return to broadcast feature’ will help to jump back into a stream after you pause to attend to something else on your device.
The former Twitter for Android developer, Sara Haider pressed hard for the earliest introduction of Periscope to Google’s mobile OS.
The similar app, Meerkat is a strong competitor of Periscope. In fact, Twitter was motivated to purchase Periscope just few weeks after Meerkat’s launch was well received and gathered a wide fan base in a very short span of time.
Meerkat has been trying to harness the first-move advantage with a private beta launch earlier this year followed by an open beta debut at the beginning of May. Competitively the Periscope has not only crafted the app very carefully for the Android devices, it even offers a few features ahead of its iOS equivalent for satisfying its users.
The users of Periscope on Android will need KitKat 4.4 or later and they can download it on the link for the Google Play Store.
