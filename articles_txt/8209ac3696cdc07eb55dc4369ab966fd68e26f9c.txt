Callaspo agrees to trade, 6-player deal with Dodgers in place

LOS ANGELES – Hours after blocking a trade that would’ve sent him to the Dodgers, veteran infielder Alberto Callaspo was in the Braves lineup Tuesday night against the Dodgers. But not for long.
In one of the most unusual transactions in recent Braves player-personnel moves, Callaspo changed his mind just before Tuesday night’s game and agreed to the six-player deal with the Dodgers that would bring veteran infielder Juan Uribe to the Braves along with hard-throwing right-hander reliever Chris Withrow.
The Braves will send left-handers Eric Stults and Ian Thomas and right-hander Juan Jaime to the Dodgers along with Callaspo, pending MLB approval of the deal, which was expected to be made official Wednesday morning. Thomas and Stults were in the Brave’s current bullpen, with Stults having lost his rotation spot earlier in the season.

Jaime, who has a 100-mph fastball but continues to battle serious control issues, already this season had been demoted from the majors to Triple-A and then to Double-A.
Withrow, 26, is recovering from Tommy John surgery and could be ready at some point in the second half of the season, though the Braves are planning to have him as a contributor in 2016. He had a 2.73 ERA in 46 relief appearances for the Dodgers during the past two seasons, with 71 strikeouts and 31 walks in 56 innings.
The deal was pending approval of the commissioner’s office, but that was considered a formality.
Only hours after Callaspo informed the Braves that he wouldn’t consent to the trade — he had that right after signing as a free agent in December — he reversed course, perhaps realizing that one way or another, he was not going to spend the rest of the season with the Braves as he hoped.
As a free agent who signed last winter, Callaspo had the right to quash any trade until June 15, per rules regarding free agency. Both Callaspo and manager Fredi Gonzalez insisted Tuesday afternoon that it was not an uncomfortable or difficult situation with the coaching staff or teammates after he initially rejected the trade.
“It’s not awkward at all,” Gonzalez said. “It’s a situation where there was something in place, it didn’t go through, he’s a part of our team and a good piece to have on our team. It (trade talks that fall apart) happens all the time. I guess with the timing of him coming out of the lineup, people knew something was up. Other than that, people wouldn’ve even have known.
“It wasn’t awkward at all. I talked to him this morning. He wants to be here obviously. And he’s in the lineup.”
At least he was, until it was announced just 15 minutes before the first pitch that Callaspo was scratched due to “trade talks being revisited.” Uribe was never in the Dodgers’ lineup Tuesday.
Uribe, 36, a backup second baseman/third baseman and pinch-hitter, has hit .247 with a .287 OBP, one homer and a .596 OPS in 87 plate appearances. A .257 career hitter with 179 home runs in 15 seasons, he hit a career-best .311 with nine homers and a .777 OPS last season in 404 plate appearances for the Dodgers.
In 2013, he famously beat the Braves in the postseason with his two-run homer off David Carpenter in the eighth inning of a division series-clinching Game 4 win.
On Monday, Callaspo was scratched from the lineup after a Braves official called Gonzalez following batting practice to tell him a trade could be completed. The Braves didn’t want to risk Callaspo getting hurt before the potential deal went through.
Callaspo was told about the pending trade Monday night, and informed the Braves Tuesday morning that he wouldn’t consent.
“I just signed my contract here, so I just want to finish my season here,” said Callaspo, 32, who signed a one-year, $3 million deal in December. “So let’s see what happens.”
Within two hours of saying that to reporters, Callaspo had dropped his refusal to be traded and agreed to the deal.
Callaspo has struggled, batting .206 with three extra-base hits (one homer) with a .293 OBP in 123 plate appearances in 37 games, and going 14-for-90 (.156) in his past 30 games. The Braves could have designated him for assignment and released him at any time, and might have done so this week with third baseman Chris Johnson coming off the 15-day disabled list later this week and second baseman Jace Peterson now the every-day second baseman.
Or, the Braves could have waited until after June 15 and try again to trade him, at which point they wouldn’t need his consent. Either way, Callaspo was guaranteed his $3 million salary.
