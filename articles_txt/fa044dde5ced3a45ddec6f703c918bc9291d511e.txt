(CNN) - Senior staff from the House committee that oversees the Secret Service have asked the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General to look into allegations that U.S. Secret Service employees circulated private personnel information about committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, Chaffetz's staff told CNN on Friday.
Chaffetz's office confirmed that the House Oversight Committee chairman applied unsuccessfully to a job with the Secret Service in 2003.
When asked about the allegations, Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback provided CNN with a statement from agency Director Joe Clancy: "Any allegations concerning potential privacy violations will be thoroughly investigated. Any USSS personnel found to have violated privacy policies will be held accountable and face appropriate administrative action."
Hoback also said the Secret Service does not usually comment on specific internal policies and declined to comment on whether any have been violated.
The Secret Service referred CNN to the investigation being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General as to whether any policies were violated.
CNN has learned that Clancy also sent a memo to staff Thursday reminding employees not to disclose personnel information.
"Disclosure of such information by employees is prohibited unless the employee to whom the information is being disclosed has a need for such record in the performance of the duties," Clancy wrote.
