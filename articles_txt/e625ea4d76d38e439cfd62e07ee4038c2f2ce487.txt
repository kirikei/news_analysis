The people In New Jersey are concerned about what he is doing (running for President) and he is not doing (governing the state). It wasn’t that long ago when Mr. Christie was extremely popular. But now the people in the state realize that who Chris Christie cares most about is Chris Christie.
Mr. Christie, govern the state for the people who elected you or demonstrate integrity by resigning.
