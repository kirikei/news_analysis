Obama pokes fun
WASHINGTON, United States (AP):
President Barack Obama welcomed Christian leaders to the White House for a prayer breakfast yesterday, taking a mild poke at some of his critics in his Easter-themed remarks.
Obama said Christians are supposed to love all their neighbours. But said he sometimes hears "less-than-loving expressions by Christians," and that concerns him.
He quickly added, "But that's a topic for another day," to laughter and applause, then joked, "I was about to veer off. I'm pulling it back."
Vice-president Joe Biden, Cardinal Donald Wuerl and the Reverend Al Sharpton were among the guests at the prayer breakfast, a post-Easter tradition of the Obama White House.
