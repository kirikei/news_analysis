Governor Rauner is not very trusting of the highest court in the state.  Rauner told the "The Daily Herald" Tuesday that he doesn't trust the Illinois Supreme Court to be rational in their decisions, saying they are part of a "corrupt system."  The comments were made while the court continues to review a 2013 pension reform law that would cut state employee benefits to help make up for a shortfall of over 100-billion dollars.
