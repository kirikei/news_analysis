Kris Jenner is owning her reputation as a momager – literally.
The Keeping Up with the Kardashians matriarch has just filed legal documents to trademark the word “momager” and embracing a nickname that has stuck ever since her family’s rise to fame, she confirmed to PEOPLE.
If her filing is granted, she would have the right to sue anyone who uses the moniker without permission, the site explains.
The nickname is an apt description for Jenner, 59, who has managed her six children for years, shrewdly building an empire and keeping the public interested in the antics of her famous family, including helping daughter Kim Kardashian West to amass a reported $28 million in 2014, per The New York Times , which recently profiled the Hollywood power broker.
