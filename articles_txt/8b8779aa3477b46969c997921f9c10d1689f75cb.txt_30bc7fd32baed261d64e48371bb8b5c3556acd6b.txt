In the days following a third straight first-round playoff exit, St. Louis Blues head coach Ken Hitchcock didn't dwell on the what ifs or sit around wondering if general manager Doug Armstrong would relieve him from his job.
He went to work, trying to figure out what will help what is a regular-season juggernaut under his watch to be more successful in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
"I needed some time to reflect and observe," Hitchcock said at Tuesday's news conference to announce his third one-year contract in St. Louis. "Six games in the playoffs [against Minnesota] felt similar to games that I coached in the regular season. I went back and watched around twenty-four or twenty-six games of similar competition [to the post-season]. I needed to see why our team performed like we did with the peaks and valleys."
Playoff Blues under 'Hitch'
2012-13 regular season: 29-17-2, 2nd in Central
Playoffs: Lost 4-2 to L.A. in West quarter-finals.
2013-14 regular season: 52-23-7, 2nd in Central
Playoffs: Lost 4-2 to Chicago in quarters.
2014-15 regular season: 51-24-7, 1st in Central
Playoffs: Lost 4-2 to Minnesota in quarters.
Hitchcock said the six-game loss to the Wild was a direct reflection of the regular season.
"The first three games we were inconsistent. Then, boom, turn it on and play like crazy in Games 4, 5 and 6," said Hitchcock, the NHL's fourth-winningest coach who returns for a fifth season. "I needed to see if it [inconsistent play] had occurred during the season and it did. Once I had that information, it allowed me to look at the personnel and look at the players and start visualizing how could I help us keep up and excel."
Hitchcock learned that the pace of the NHL game "is like never before" and said it will be his job and that of assistant coaches Kirk Muller, Ray Bennett and Brad Shaw to get the most out of each player.
"I think, internally, we can really quicken our team," he said, "and we're going to have to, to keep up to where the league's at."
The Blues captured their second Central Division title under Hitchcock this season also boast the best regular-season record during the Edmonton native's four-year tenure at 175-79-27. Problem is, they last competed in a Western Conference final in 2001 under Joel Quenneville, now with the Chicago Blackhawks.
Ken Hitchcock gets a stay of execution. Still a great coach, just hasn't been able to take STL to next level. Muller in wings, I imagine.
Hitchcock, 63, sports an all-time regular-season record of 708-429-185 but his post-season mark over appearances is less flattering at 76-72, but does include a Stanley Cup title with Dallas in 1999.
St. Louis has gained a playoff berth in each season under Hitchcock as well as three 100-point seasons and two Central championships.
Hitchcock has enjoyed other successes including:
Becoming the fourth coach in NHL history to reach 700 regular-season victories on March 12, 2015.
Becoming the fourth coach in Blues history to be named NHL coach of the year in 2012.
Leading his teams (Dallas, Philadelphia, Columbus, St. Louis) to eight division titles and 11, 100-point seasons.
Coaching Canada to a silver medal at the 2008 world hockey championship.
Winning an Olympic gold medal as associate coach with Canada in 2002, 2010 and 2014.
But in a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately business, defenceman Kevin Shattenkirk was St. Louis' leading scorer in these playoffs with eight assists while right-winger Vladimir Tarasenko, the team's top point-getting in the regular season with 73, added six goals and seven points in the post-season.
T.J. Oshie, Alex Steen, Jaden Schwartz, David Backes, Paul Stastny and Ryan Reaves combined for six goals.
Blues general manager Doug Armstrong said there was a decided change in the style of players added for this season, a list that included forwards Stastny (four-year, $28-million US free-agent contract) and Jori Lehtera.
'We are going to have a different look [to start next season]. We're going to explore improving our team to levels that we haven't explored in the past, but it has to make sense.'
- Blues GM Doug Armstrong
"We went through the ebbs and flows of those types of players," Armstrong told reporters. "I'm not saying they're not competitive players … but when you spend upwards of four, five years before Ken got here and what we were trying to build and you add different style of players in there, I thought there were some bumps in the road that we haven't had in the past. I thought those bumps continued in the playoffs.
"We are going to have a different look [to start next season]. We're going to explore improving our team to levels that we haven't explored in the past, but it has to make sense," Armstrong added.
The GM's immediate focus will be re-signing the Blues' restricted free agents, a pool that includes goalie Jake Allen, defenceman Robert Bortuzzo and Tarasenko. Armstrong also mentioned there could be a conversation with the representative for left-winger Schwartz, who will be a RFA next summer.
"We believe we're fortunate to have two cores — an aging core of players in their late 20s to early 30s and we have a young core in their lower to mid-20s," said Armstrong. "I want to make sure we're servicing both of those cores but understanding the long-term look at this franchise is with Schwartz, Tarasenko, [defenceman] Alex [Pietrangelo], Shattenkirk [and] Allen."
Hitchcock said it's the first time since he arrived in St. Louis that he sensed anger and disappointment from his players following a playoff loss.
"This is the first time I've seen that the players feel like we underperformed in the playoffs from what we did in the regular season," he said. "I think we're going to see an even higher level of focus [next season] than we've seen. I think we're going to see a whole other gear."

If there was any uncertainty that Ken Hitchcock was still a good fit for the Blues, any concern that the team’s pursuit of Mike Babcock could create turmoil in the locker room, or any worry that bringing a coach back on a one-year contract would be an issue, it wasn’t heard Tuesday afternoon.
In a 30-minute-plus news conference announcing that Hitchcock will be returning for the 2015-16 season, everyone involved made it seem as though it was the right move.
Blues general manager Doug Armstrong said that his findings after a 28-day evaluation process led him to this decision, Hitchcock said he had some “unfinished business,” and despite rumblings of a disconnect in the locker room, captain David Backes said that Tuesday’s news made sense from the players’ perspective.
If all this is true, what took so long?
Armstrong spent part of the time attending the IIHF World Championships in the Czech Republic, where it’s believed he spoke with Babcock. He then returned to St. Louis, where he met with Hitchcock three times, including Tuesday morning, before making the announcement official.
“There wasn’t a checklist of things,” Armstrong said. “We just sat down and we talked. We talked about the season, we talked about the playoffs, we talked about personnel. One of the things, I just had to make sure that the passion level that’s going to be necessary in November, December, January, February — the dog days of the season — that Ken still had that passion.
“I didn’t want him to come back and feel that he was coming back out of anger and disappointment. I wanted him to come back out of excitement and energy. When we talked, I felt that. I felt that talking to him and I felt that talking to members of his staff that there’s a real excitement in getting back to work here.”
Armstrong also announced Wednesday that Hitchcock’s entire coaching staff — associate head coach Brad Shaw and assistants Kirk Muller, Ray Bennett and Jim Corsi and video coach Sean Ferrell — would be back next season.
That was something that Hitchcock, while discussing his return for a fifth season, said he wanted to see happen.
“I’m really proud to be able to coach this hockey club again and I’m really proud the staff is back together,” Hitchcock said. “I wanted to be back here badly. The emotion, when the series was first over, was get me away from here. Then as it started to move on, I really wanted to come back and finish the job here. It’s really unfinished business for me.
“There was a time where you’re not really sure as the process is moving along. Then it got overridden by the passion to coach and teach. Doug takes care of the franchise in a really strong way. I was comfortable he was going to do what was right for the organization short- and long-term. That’s his job and I was comfortable with his decision.”
According to league sources, Armstrong’s first choice, however, was not Hitchcock. He received permission from Detroit to speak with Babcock, who turned down the club’s overtures before signing an eight-year, $50 million deal with Toronto.
Armstrong has said recently that he will not disclose whether he spoke with Babcock or any other potential candidates. On Wednesday, though, he was speaking as if it never happened.
“When you look over the season, the number of things you read, if one-tenth of that ever came true in the NHL, I’d be shocked,” he said. “I think it’s the media’s job responsibility to sometime report the facts and sometimes make stuff up because it’s good story.”
True or not, Hitchcock heard it.
“You can’t help but not do that,” Hitchcock said. “I don’t care. The reason I don’t care is that we have a relationship where we can tell each other pretty much anything, and there’s no consequences. I know one thing: He keeps me informed on everything. Some of it I don’t want to hear sometimes, but it’s information that’s necessary. And to me, the verbal information that I get Doug to tell me overrides everything else. The other stuff is irrelevant to me. It’s the relationship you have with the people that you work with and for, and that’s all that matters.”
Asked if he felt the reports would impact Hitchcock’s leadership ability in the Blues’ locker room, Armstrong replied: “Not really.”
Backes said he didn’t foresee issues either.
“For the management and the ownership not to pursue all options — whether a job was offered or they wanted to talk and see if there’s a different fit there with a different coach — I think they’d be amiss not doing their due diligence,” Backes said. “It’s a business. In the end, they came back and they said that Hitch is their guy and he’s got a one-year deal to prove that he can get a job done.”
Speaking of that, the fact that it’s a only a one-year extension is another concern, but apparently only outside the organization.
“I don’t want to cheat them,” Hitchcock, 63, said. “I don’t want to be signing on for a bunch of years that I know I can’t answer the bell for. So for me, this is a perfect scenario. What’s good for me continuing to coach is stay short term, so that I have the energy.”
Armstrong pointed out that in 2013-14, Hitchcock was coaching in the final year of his contract. In 2014-15, he played out his one-year option. Next year will be the same situation.
“The reality is, this is Ken’s third one-year deal,” Armstrong said. “So, this isn’t something new for Ken and I. This is something that we’re comfortable with.”
Armstrong said he was dumbfounded by the narrative that a one-year contract structure created lame-duck status for Hitchcock and the possibility that players would not compete for a coach who doesn’t have future security.
“The thought process that someone works with less passion and energy because someone is on a one-year deal, I’ve never really understood that or comprehended that,” Armstrong said. “I would be shocked if a player wants to flush a year of his career away because the coach is on a one-year deal. If you just look at it rationally, it makes no sense to worry about the length of someone’s contract because their own careers are at stake now also.”
Said Backes: “I don’t know what would be the benefits of thinking in those terms. Whether he’s got a one-year deal or a five-year deal, he’s the coach, we’re the players, we’ve got to perform on the ice.”
Backes didn’t deny Tuesday that there have been rifts, but he said it’s part of the business.
“I’ve got no issues with (Hitchcock),” Backes said. “Does he ride guys hard and has he been on my case at times, where it’s made me angry? Yes. But he does it in the light of trying to make our team better, trying to make each individual player better.
“I think for the first time being here, there has been a few comments to the paper that may have (shown) some disagreements with whatever was going on. But you look at any work place, if there’s not disagreements about what’s going on, you’re living in Pleasantville, I think.”
Armstong added: “Show me a well-liked coach, and I’ll show you a losing coach in most organizations.”
The Blues believe they’ve still got the right coach, and the coach believes he’s still with the right organization.
“I want to coach to win and I couldn’t find a better spot than to show up right here and coach this hockey club,” Hitchcock said. “This is a really good team trying to become a great team. I think I have the tools and the expertise to help them along the way.
“Doug and I have been together for a very long period of time. We’ve got great communication and the ability to get this team back to the playoffs and back into that hunt again is first and foremost in both of our minds.”
