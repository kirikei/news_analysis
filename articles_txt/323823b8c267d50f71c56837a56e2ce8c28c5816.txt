Halliburton Co. and BP PLC have agreed to settle all remaining claims related to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the companies said Wednesday.
Houston-based Halliburton performed the oil-well cementing on the Deepwater Horizon rig, which was owned by Transocean Ltd. and operated by BP.
As part of the deal, Halliburton and BP Exploration & Production Inc. agreed to dismiss pending claims against each other.
