NEW YORK — A New York City woman is accused of marrying 10 times over an 11-year period without ever getting a divorce.
Liana Barrientos is charged with filing a fake instrument.
The Bronx district attorney’s office says she faces two counts of felony fraud charges at her arraignment Friday.
According to a criminal complaint, the 39-year-old woman allegedly obtained two of the marriage licenses in the Bronx. It says the others were obtained in Westchester County and Long Island. The first one allegedly was obtained in 1999.
The complaint says she was arrested following a probe of her most recent marriage in 2010.
It wasn’t immediately clear if she had a lawyer.
