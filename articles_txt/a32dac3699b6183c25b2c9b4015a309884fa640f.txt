The ‘coolest’ US first lady Michelle Obama has Americans matching steps with her after she performed a funky dance number during an annual Easter programme at the White House.
Tuesday's performance was part of her campaign titled Let’s Move aimed at encouraging children to eat healthy and exercise.
The 51-year-old first lady, who has appeared in TV dance shows earlier, joined a group of young dancers to groove to the tune of Uptown Funk, a hit number released in 2014.

The event on the south lawns of the White House saw a gathering of thousands of visitors, including children who took part in the famous egg roll race, cooking classes and fitness sessions.
President Barrack Obama played a game of tennis with young participants.
The White House later released pictures of the Obamas on Easter.
The photo of the first family including first dogs Bo and Sunny was released via Instagram with the caption “From the Obama family to yours, Happy Easter!”
While the President wore a dark gray tailored suit with a lavender tie, Michelle Obama opted for a teal hued, sleeveless sheath dress.
