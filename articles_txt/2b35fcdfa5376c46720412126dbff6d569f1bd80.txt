CHICAGO (AP) -
Gov. Bruce Rauner has issued his first two pardons since becoming governor nearly three months ago.
   The (Champaign) News-Gazette reports over the weekend that the pardons by the Republican went to Neil Hebert and Michael Sullivan. Rauner rejected 57 other clemency petitions.
   The 43-year-old Hebert was convicted of theft in Champaign County when he was 20. He served two years of probation. The News-Gazette says Sullivan was convicted of burglary in Cook County in 1979.
   Rauner's office says he inherited nearly 3,000 clemency petitions as he took over as governor.
   The News-Gazette says his immediate predecessor, Democrat Pat Quinn, himself inherited about 2,500 petitions from Rod Blagojevich. Quinn reviewed more than 4,900 petitions, granted around 1,800 and denied some 3,130.
