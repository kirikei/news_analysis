DESTIN, Fla. | The SEC is taking another step to keep concussed players off the field.
The league will have an independent medical observer for all football games played by league teams.
That person will be in the replay booth and be selected by the conference and has the authority to stop the game to remove an injured player.
“That will give us another check in the event that on the field the team doesn’t really see someone that may have had a head injury,” outgoing SEC commissioner Mike Slive said.
A “couple of schools,” already operated with an independent medical observer last season, incoming commissioner Greg Sankey said.
Slive says this “gives us a safety net,” in case sidelines don’t pick up a player injured.
Georgia head coach Mark Richt said director of sports medicine Ron Courson is the “forefront” for concussion protocol.
“We’ve always been very careful to do what he thinks is best and the best practice,” Richt said. “I’m comfortable with what we’re doing at Georgia.”
