HOUSTON – He’s had it for three years. Now, a Texas driver is being told to hand over his license plate, or it will be suspended .  The state has deemed the plate unacceptable.
There are more than 120,000 personalized license plates available in Texas. Safeer Hasaan has had one on his Lamborghini for the last three years, according to KPRC.  It reads, “370h55V.”
The problem is the state says this puzzling alpha-numeric jumble is no longer acceptable. They told him, “It has been determined that the personalization is offensive.”
Haven’t figured it out why this plate could be considered offensive? How about when we flip it over?  You’re now looking at a blurred out cuss word, and it took the state some time to reach the conclusion.
Here’s the rule for revocation:  “Would it invoke a response from other drivers that would be driving past that vehicle.”
Hasaan argues his plate doesn’t meet that standard, saying “I definitely think the state is overreaching their boundaries.”
Hassan said he is strongly considering appealing the state’s decision.
