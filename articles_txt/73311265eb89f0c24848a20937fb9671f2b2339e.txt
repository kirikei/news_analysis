BATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) - Governor Bobby Jindal went on NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday to speak about controversial bills being signed into law in Indiana and Arkansas
"We're not talking about restaurants denying service to people who want to come and have dinner. We're not talking about day-to-day, routine commercial transactions," says Jindal, "We're talking about a very specific example here of business owners, of florists, of musicians, of caterers who are being forced to either pay thousands of dollars or close their businesses if they don't want to participate in a wedding ceremony that contradicts their religious beliefs."
Jindal went on to say that he was "Disappointed" that the Indiana and Arkansas legislatures amended the bill to say that business owners may not use the Religious Freedom bill as an excuse to deny services to same-sex couples.
The bill has received large amounts of attention from protesters, companies, and celebrities who say that they will scale back operations in Indiana due to the bill.
