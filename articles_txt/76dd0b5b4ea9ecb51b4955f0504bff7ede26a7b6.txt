Resplendent in red and gold, this is Samsung’s attempt to bring together its Marvel tie-ins with its latest slightly weird S6 Edge handset. The result is… probably not the phone Tony Stark would choose?
The fully Iron Man-themed package includes an arc reactor-esque wireless charger, which you can see in the video below, along with a clear cover to protect the 64GB version of the S6 Edge. But cosmetic tweaks aside — including that big old Iron Man face on the back — there’s little to differentiate it from the standard version of the phone. So you can breathe a sigh of relief when you find out that, for now at least, the phone will only be available in South Korea, China and Hong Kong. Bad luck, Marvel fans. [ Engadget ]
