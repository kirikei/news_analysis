Sen. Marco Rubio is not worried that Hillary Clinton might be stepping on his big announcement .
The Florida Republican is expected to make official on Monday evening that he will run for president — the day after Clinton is poised to let the world know via social media that she’ll aim for the White House once again.
Rubio’s announcement “will offer an optimistic vision for a new American century,” said Alex Conant, a spokesman for the senator. “He will offer new ideas for the new challenges facing our nation in the 21st century. The contrast between Marco’s new generation ideas and Hillary Clinton’s outdated policies will be clear.”
Anybody who thinks a Hillary video on Sun will overshadow a Marco  speech on Mon, has either never seen a Hillary video or a Marco speech…
In an interview with Breitbart News, Rubio criticized Clinton as the “architect of a failed foreign policy” as secretary of State. He’s also described her as representative of “yesterday” during his remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February and nothing more than “Obama’s third term.”
Rubio released a video yesterday of clips from his speeches that highlight his vision for “a new American century” and contrasts him with policies advanced by the Obama administration.
