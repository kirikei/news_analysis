Your Right to Know
WASHINGTON -- Dressed in a pink dress shirt and colorful bow tie Monday, 11-year-old Evan Ellsworth bounced a basketball, swung a tennis racket, and rolled a blue Easter egg at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.
His mother, Wendy Ellsworth, said it was wonderful her son had a “ray of sunshine” and a “ once in a lifetime opportunity” at the Egg Roll, a tradition that began in 1878 under President Rutherford B. Hayes.
“It’s something that’s going to be forever etched in my heart, I mean, the weather was perfect, sometimes things just happen, all come together,” said Wendy, a Westerville resident. “It really was a beautiful day, and... we really enjoyed it, just everybody’s in a good mood and festive.”
For Evan, the trip capped off his recovery from a concussion he suffered last year when he collided with another player in a soccer game. But now he’s back on his feet and playing basketball again.
“When we got there, we got in line to play basketball in the president’s basketball court, and that was my personal favorite part,” said Evan.
President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama hosted the event, which included thousands of people on the White House South Lawn.
Wanting to cheer her son up after his injury, Wendy Ellsworth wrote the office of Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Genoa Township, asking how Evan could attend the Egg Roll. Then, “out of the clear blue” a few weeks ago, Wendy got a call from a Tiberi staffer, saying the congressman had two tickets for them.
“I picked him up from school and he’d got in the car, and I turned around I said, ‘You’re not going to believe this. You’re going to the White House Easter Egg Roll.”
