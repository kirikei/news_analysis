BEIJING: Amid escalating tensions with the US over disputed South China Sea, China on Tuesday unveiled an assertive military strategy enhancing its naval reach for the first time to "open seas protection" far from its shores, which could pose a challenge to the Indian Navy, especially in the Indian Ocean.
Striking an aggressive posture, China also outlined plans to build two lighthouses in disputed islands in South China Sea (SCS), which could further fuel tensions with maritime neighbours — Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei — backed by the US in their opposition to Chinese claims of sovereignty to whole of SCS.
With the world's largest standing army of 2.3 million troops, China's annual defence budget of over $145 billion this year is far higher than India's $40 billion.
As the Chinese military unveiled the first white paper on defence strategy stressing on "active defence", China's ministry of transport hosted a groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of two multi-functional lighthouses in the disputed Nansha islands, known as Spratly islands in the SCS.
Defending the construction of light houses which were bound to stir up fresh rounds of tensions in the SCS, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chuying told media that their major purpose is to fulfil international responsibilities and obligations, including maritime search and rescue and disaster relief.
She also lashed out at the Philippines' accusation that China is bullying its smaller neighbours. "Here is a piece of advice for the Philippines. China will never bully smaller countries but they must not take provocative actions ceaselessly and wilfully. We will stick to the rational course. We hope the Philippines will stop provoking and come back to the right track of negotiations," she said.
From India's point of view, the white paper highlights four critical security domains, including the ocean, outer space, cyberspace and nuclear weapons.
China's plans to make the navy a blue water navy could pose a major challenge to Indian Navy.
