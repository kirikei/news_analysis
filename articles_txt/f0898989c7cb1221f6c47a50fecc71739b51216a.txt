BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter has vetoed legislation that would have made roughly 250 slot-like betting machines in Idaho illegal.
But Otter did put a moratorium on any new instant racing machines in the state. The governor also asked the Legislature to join him in appointing a special investigator to assess the legality of the machines that are currently in use.
"I neither expected nor desired it to supplant live horse racing in Idaho, and it is my firm intention to limit and restrict this type of gambling in Idaho to race tracks," said Otter in a statement dated April 3.
Otter delayed announcing his decision on SB 1011, even though the deadline to sign the legislation was on April 4, saying he wanted to talk to lawmakers.
Known as instant horse racing, the machines allow bettors to place wages on prior horse races with no identifiable information. Idaho lawmakers approved legalizing the machines in 2013.
However, backers of the bill —including the Coeur d'Alene Tribe— have argued this legislative session that the machines are essentially slot machines, which are illegal under Idaho's Constitution.
The Idaho Legislature now may vote on whether to override the veto, which requires two-thirds of the vote in each house.
