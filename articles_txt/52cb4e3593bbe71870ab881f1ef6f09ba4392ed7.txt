Rauner also reappointed Michael Prueter of Naperville to another term on the board. He is a onetime chairman of the Lisle Township Republican Organization, and he first started on the board in 2010 via an appointment from then-Gov. Pat Quinn.
The post pays $93,926 per year.
The announcement is part of string of Rauner Friday-afternoon appointments he's made as he continues to change the makeup of state government three months after starting on the job.
One of his first moves was to appoint longtime Biggert chief of staff Kathy Lydon to be his go-to in Washington, D.C.
