Mayor de Blasio may have a record of tardiness, perhaps because he makes sure to stop at the bathroom before appearances?
On Tuesday's "Tonight Show," Louis C.K. recounted a tale of joking around with de Blasio at recent roast. 
But before he made his appareance on stage with New York City's mayor, Louis wanted to take a quick detour to the restroom.
"I'm trying to pee quickly — I'm sort of pushing to get the pee out, and it's too much pressure. And out the back, pop! Just, pop! I'm a urinal, and boom, out the back. ... Boom, I've got wet underwear, and the mayor's waiting for me. I couldn't do anything, I'm like, 'We gotta go'... And then I stood next to the mayor of New York City and did a whole thing with poop in my pants. It's the kind of stuff that happens."
So did Louis really stand next to Mayor de Blasio with poop in his pants? You can watch the clip of the March 2015 performance here and perhaps determine for yourself.
