The PGA Tour isn’t leaving the Lone Star state just yet. The pros will tee off in the Dallas area for the AT&T Byron Nelson at TPC Four Seasons in Los Colinas, Texas.
This par 70 stretches 7,166 yards and was redesigned in 2007 to feature major undulation on the putting surfaces and several water hazards to navigate. Precision ball striking and tidy putting will get the job done.
Fantasy owners may have a tougher time building against DFS pricing that is relative to the field’s scope of talent. Spend up, but there should be a lot of wiggle room for low-end buys to make up the difference in most contests.
Build around
Jordan Spieth : Dallas born, Spieth was T2 last week at Colonial after falling on his face during Day 2 competition. The resiliency is an intangible that only further endears him to fantasy owners.
Jason Day : Probably the best go-low in the field, or at least among the top three … Day is a past winner here (2010) and has carved up the course with top-10s in three of his last four appearances. The lone exception was just a T27 in 2013.
Jimmy Walker : Don’t be discouraged after last week’s debacle. Walker is too good and a proven winner in his home state. He easily could win this thing come Sunday afternoon. No. 1 in strokes gained: putting.
Dustin Johnson : Everyone knows he has the length to overpower any course, but this one will take most everything he has to offer within 100 yards. He certainly could hoist the trophy this year, but finishing in the top five is definitely within reach if a win isn’t automatic.
Brandt Snedeker : Even though he didn’t make the cut here in 2014, use last week’s performance as a barometer. As long as he doesn’t lose too many off the box, Sneds has arguably the best flat stick in this field (third in strokes gained: putting). He could win if he’s dialed in and Spieth or Day do not go bonkers.
Draws
Ian Poulter : No. 38 in greens in regulation and 18th in strokes gained: putting. While he isn’t winning tournaments, Poulter is consistently putting up the numbers needed as a No. 2 golfer in daily contests. Ride the hot streak by pairing him with Spieth, Day or DJ.
Brendon Todd : Last year’s winner also has a T17 under his belt from his 2013 efforts. He missed the cuts in his prior two attempts. Todd’s 86% cuts-made rate in 2014-15 and No. 20 ranking in strokes gained: putting are tough to ignore.
Russell Henley : A fresh face to the Byron Nelson, Henley has been as productive as any midrange player in his last four PGA events (T24, MC, 21, 4). Expect a respectable but not overwhelming performance. Ranks seventh in strokes gained: putting.

Zach Johnson : Precision is the name of his game, and Johnson can do magical things if his putter is hot. His approach game tends to put him into the best situation to mask his on-green deficiencies.
George McNeill : Ranks 32nd in strokes gained: putting and has been on fire of late, with four top-20 finishes in his last seven starts, including a T5 last week at Colonial.
Justin Thomas : Pay for recent form. New to the track but has played so well that it’s tough seeing him not being in the conversation of viable DFS draws. A top-10 would be a fine result and somewhat of a fantasy victory.
Charlie Hoffman : He shot a 7-under 273 aggregate here in 2014 for a T8 and posted a T23 back in 2009. Last week’s play was encouraging, as well. Good middle-tier value.
Wild cards
Jason Dufner : Past winner. The price is right in most DFS contests … his game is largely a mess, but he can still net out as a four-day performer with No. 3 production. If owners are lucky, Duf will get on a hot streak and surprise.
Ryan Palmer : Texas native … used to playing in the local-area conditions and has thrived on this track (T22, T33, T9, 2) in his last four trips. Recent play is uninspiring.
Brian Harman : Probably doesn’t stand a snowball’s chance in Dallas to win it, but that shouldn’t be a consideration in why owners play him. Ranks 51st in SGP and has finished inside the top 30 each of the last two years at TPC Four Seasons.
Aaron Baddeley : Ranks 15th in strokes gained: putting. Generally plays well in Texas … has made only one of his last four cuts in 2015, but he’s cheap in most contests.

Robert Allenby: Allenby looks for spark at AT&T Byron Nelson
Robert Allenby touches down in Irving, Texas, for his 12th appearance at the AT&T Byron Nelson Championship.
There hasn't been much to write home about for Allenby, missing more cuts (10) than he's made (six) and arrives 162nd in the FedExCup standings. The Aussie started out like gangbusters with a T8 in the season-opener Frys.com Open, and that's it. He hasn't cracked the top 40 since. The 43-year-old posted a respectable T37 in last year's BNC where overall, he's 9-for-11 with two top 10s. Those two top 10s however, came a long, long time ago, in another lifetime.
