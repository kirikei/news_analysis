Amnesty International has accused the Palestinian group, Hamas, of a brutal campaign of abduction, torture and killings against its own people.
Amnesty documents more than 20 cases of what it says were extra-judicial executions during last year's conflict with Israel.
The organisation says many victims of torture were members of the rival Palestinian movement, Fatah.
