CHARLESTON, S.C. (CNN/WIS) — Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry says there’s plenty he’ll do in office, if he runs for president. Perry has not formally announced a presidential run, but he told a group of cadets at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, that he would make some changes regarding international affairs.
“Should I run for president and be so fortunate as to be elected, one of my first actions in office would be to invalidate the present Iran agreement, which jeopardizes the safety and security of the free world,” said Perry.
