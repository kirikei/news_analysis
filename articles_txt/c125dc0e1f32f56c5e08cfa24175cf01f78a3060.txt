Governor Rick Scott is reversing course and says he no longer supports Medicaid expansion, in a move that threatens to undo budget talks between the state House and Senate. 
The governor expressed concerns that the federal government might not make good on their promise to fund Medicaid for an additional 800,000 Floridians. 
Scott originally opposed expansion, but in an emotional speech two years ago he came out in support.
