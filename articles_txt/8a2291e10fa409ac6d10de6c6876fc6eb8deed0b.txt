State officials are seeking to create federal cybersecurity laws that would protect consumers from identity theft and data breaches as Americans become increasingly reliant on technology.
Congressman Jim Langevin announced Tuesday the introduction of three bills aimed at protecting consumers from cybercrime. Langevin was joined by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin and Rhode Island State Police Col. Steven O'Donnell.
The legislation would increase consumer protection by requiring companies to disclose data breaches within 30 days of their discovery. It would also make it easier to prosecute criminals who trade in stolen credit cards.
A third bill would enable guardians and parents to protect their children's credit from identity thieves.
Langevin says he will introduce the bills next week in Washington.
