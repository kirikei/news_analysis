 A broad coalition of business, civil liberties, and religious groups today called on the Texas Legislature to reject so called 'Religious Freedom Restoration' measures, claiming they are unnecessary and would damage the state's economy, News Radio 1200 WOAI news reports.
  "The people who propose that these amendments to our state constitution are needed because our religious liberty is under threat are wrong," Rebecca Robertson, head of the Texas American Civil Liberties Union, told the group.
  As many as 16 bills are in the works which would essentially allow businesses and individuals to decline to serve, for example, gay and lesbian customers if it would violate their 'deeply held religious beliefs.'
  A similar bill passed in Indiana prompted several large corporations to threaten to pull out or not expand in that state, prompting the Indiana Legislature to revise the bills.
 
 
  Bill Hammond, CEO of the Texas Association of Business, echoed Anchia's comments, saying he is worried that employers would either move out of the state or not locate here if RFRA bills are passed.
 State Sen. Donna Campbell (R-New Braunfels) is the leading proponent of a Religious Freedom constitutional amendment, saying practicing Christians are in danger from the LGBT community.
