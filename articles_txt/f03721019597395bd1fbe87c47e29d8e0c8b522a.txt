Rand is making a stand.
Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul on Monday released a highly produced YouTube video titled “A Different Kind of Republican Leader” that all but promised that the Tea Party favorite will launch his 2016 campaign on Tuesday.
“On April 7, a different kind of Republican will take on Washington,” the opening of the three-minute spot reads in bold text.
A smattering of flattering media clips follows, with the ad then seguing into a mash-up of Paul’s speeches.
“It’s time for a new way, a new set of ideas, a new leader. One you can trust,” Paul is shown saying. “It’s time for a new president.”
Text then appears on the screen that makes little secret of the Kentucky senator’s intentions.

‘It’s time for a new president,’ Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul says in the video.
“On April 7 one leader will stand up to defeat the Washington machine and unleash the American dream,” the ad says.
Paul had been rumored for weeks to have been eyeing early April as the time for his 2016 campaign announcement.
When Paul does announce, he will become the second Republican to formally launch a bid, after Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who jumped into the race officially last month.
