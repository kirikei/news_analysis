PORTAGE, Indiana — City council members in Portage have approved a resolution asking Indiana state lawmakers to repeal the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
The (Munster) Times reports ( http://bit.ly/1HUqSWo ) the Tuesday night vote was 5-2. The state's new religious objections law has come under criticism that it could sanction discrimination against homosexuals. Republicans scrambled to clarify that businesses can't use the law as a defense to deny services.
Despite the changes, Councilman Mark Oprisko said he still thinks it's important to repeal the legislation.
Portage Mayor James Snyder says he needs time to consider whether he will sign the resolution. He says it is "essential" to find out what the people of Portage think first. Snyder says the resolution quotes "people who don't specifically represent the interests of Portage."
