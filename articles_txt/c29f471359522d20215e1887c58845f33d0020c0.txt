Android M to launch at Google I/O: Marshmallow, Muffin or Malai barfi? The guessing game continues
While Google may have chosen to name its next version Lollipop over laddoo or licorice or whatever you wished, looks like the guessing game for its next iteration will begin soon. Yes, Google has disclosed the schedule for its I/O event to be held later this month and seems like Android M will be at the show.
One of the sessions called ‘Android for Work Update’ had revealed, “Android M is bringing the power of Android to all kinds of workplaces.” Google is known to name its mobile OS versions in alphabetical order, so it’s quite likely that after Lollipop, the next name will begin with the letter ‘M’. According to ArsTechnica, Google had pulled out the description, but not before the news site got its hands on a screenshot.
So, its not yet official if Google is announcing its next iteration Android M at the event, but several users have already guessing a probable name. Some early favourites are Muffin, Mud pie and Meringue. The new report points out the Android version is internally called Macadamia Nut Cookie or MNC, but will get a new name during the launch (Marshmallow, Mudpie or so on). Some reports have been betting on ‘Marshmallow’ as the next probabale name of Google mobile OS iteration.
How about Indian dessert like Malai Barfi or Malpoa? In fact, last year a group of students from IIT-Kharagpur – which also happens to be Pichai’s alma mater – have been lobbying for the next version of Android to be named Lassi. Google also ensured the fun continues as it announced the next iteration simply as Android L and named it only after the version was ready to ship. This ensured a lot of speculation and buzz around the name.
Android 'M' is coming… Marshmallow? M&M? Muffin? Marzipan? Either way, can't wait to see it at I/O.
Android M coming out this month. Lets hope @Android selects Malpoa or Malai Barfi
Any other names you guys think would be suitable?

Prior to that Google chose KitKat by booting out the long-time rumoured Key lime pie. Google had also created a landing page for Kitkat. It created similar buzz with reports about if Nestle’s paid Google or vice versa for using the name KitKat. However, John Lagerling, director of Android global partnerships, quickly said, “This is not a money-changing-hands kind of deal” . Keylime Pie reportedly got the boot as Google realised that not too many people knew the actual taste of a Keylime pie.
So what do you think? What ‘sweet’ name  will Google release for Android M? Let us know. We’d love to see more options.
