President Barack Obama along with his family was present at the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria to spend Easter Sunday. They also posed for an official White House photo.
At the historic black church in Virginia, the minister gave a sermon, which had parts of politics and scripture. The church’s pastor, the Rev. Howard-John Wesley, 42, gave a sermon with regard to the responsibility of choice.
The church dates back to 1803 and is known for its liberal positions, like support for civil rights for same-sex couples. Wesley said that it was an honor to celebrate Easter with the President.
People were excited to see Obama and gave him rock star treatment. But Wesley asked people to let him worship in the house of God.
Also, as a part of the annual Operation Easter at First Baptist Church in Bryan, a helicopter dispersed more than 20,000 Easter eggs. It was raining, but then also many children got into race to collect as many as they could.
Senior Pastor Jim Heiligman was of the view that they have organized the event for those to come to church who normally does not attend. “We were just as a staff and as a church trying to think outside of the box and think of creative ways this Easter Sunday to attract people in our community not only to give them something fun and different to do”, said Heiligman.
He affirmed that their main aim was to make them come to their campus with a hope that they would attend one of the worship services. Organizers said that they were happy that the rain stopped and the children were able to collect all of those Easter eggs.
