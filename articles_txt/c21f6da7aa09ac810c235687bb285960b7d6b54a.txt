One recent piece of legislation at the state level could end up banning nearly all abortions in Alabama if passed.
A bill was recently proposed in the Alabama legislature by Rep. Terri Collins , R-Decatur, that bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, according to a report from the Associated Press.
Collins argues that if the traditional definition of death is determined by the absence of a heartbeat, then the beginning of life must start with a heartbeat.
Nikema Williams of Planned Parenthood Southeast referred to the bill as "dangerous and blatantly unconstitutional," saying the bill would ban abortions six weeks into pregnancy, before a woman could be aware that she is pregnant.
A similar law in North Dakota last year was ruled unconstitutional, but Collins said she wants to focus on language in the bill that will be acceptable to the courts.
