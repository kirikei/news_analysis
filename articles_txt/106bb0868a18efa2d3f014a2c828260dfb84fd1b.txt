Washington • Utah and seven other states where identical-sex couples can marry are amongst 15 states urging the Supreme Court to uphold gay marriage bans and leave the matter to voters and lawmakers.
These states are telling the justices in a short filed Thursday that the court would do "incalculable harm to our civic life" if it decides that exact same-sex couples need to be allowed to marry nationwide.
The states say they need to be absolutely free to choose the concern for themselves.
The eight states where gay and lesbian couples can marry immediately after courts struck down bans on gay marriage are: Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia.
Seven other states where exact same-sex marriage remains illegal also joined the brief. They are: Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Texas.
