LAS VEGAS (AP) - The Clark County district attorney's office says it will pursue five misdemeanor charges against the 73-year-old brother of U.S. Sen. Harry Reid including driving under the influence, battery, a weapons charge and not wearing a seatbelt.
An arrest report released Thursday provided more information about Larry Joe Reid's arrest on Feb. 2 when a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper found him sitting in his SUV on a highway 95 median.
The report says Reid swore at the trooper and drove away with the trooper clinging to the side. The trooper says in the report he reached for Reid's keys and steering wheel and eventually pointed his gun at Reid demanding he stop. The report says Reid punched the trooper twice when the officer reached across, eventually putting the car in park.
