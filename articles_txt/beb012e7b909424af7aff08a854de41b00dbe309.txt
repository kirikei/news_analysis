Looks like love is on top for The Bachelorette's Britt Nilsson and Brady Toops.
We told you last week that the reality show contestants were dating and going strong  and during last night's episode it was finally confirmed that the two are officially BFGF.
Brady apparently couldn't wait to share his excitement over his new relationship! Less than 24 hours had passed after the big reveal before he posted three photos of him and Britt being all cute and cuddly. 
And nothing says official more than a couple's first selfie! In the sweet black and white pic,  Brady shows off an enthusiastic smile as Britt pulls him in close and lays a kiss on his cheek. 
He proudly introduces his Instagram followers to his new gal pal saying, "Behind the scenes from Episode 3 of The Bachelorette.. the beauty herself, miss @brittkarolina y'all!"

In another shot,  Britt, dressed in a black leather jacket, floral top and black pants, has her arms around Brady's waist. Brady, in a maroon beanie and gray T-shirt, is gripping his new girlfriend as they both intently look into the gorgeous sunset.
He captioned the magical moment with an inspiring quote, "'Never waste any amount of time doing anything important when there is a sunset outside that you should be sitting under.' – C. JoyBell C."
Is this even real life?!
But it's not all serious sunsets for these two. Brady posted a third pic of himself and his lady love showing off their silly side while out on a hike.

The casual couple were decked out in their finest workout gear for their outdoor adventure. Britt showed off her toned arms in a gray sleeveless top and accentuated her tiny waist by tying a sweatshirt around her hips.
She is standing back to back with Brady, who is obviously a fan of beanies, this time sporting a black one to match his all-black-everything look. 
Britt wasn't going to let Brady have all the fun. She posted the same photo on her Instagram page with the caption, "Mean muggin @bradytoops". 
Looks like we will just have to keep an eye on these two (and their social media accounts) to see if they will defy the reality dating show odds and further prove that true love can be found on The Bachelorette.
