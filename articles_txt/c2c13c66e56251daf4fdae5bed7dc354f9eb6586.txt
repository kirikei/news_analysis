TALLAHASSEE — Florida's top election official is opposing a push by the state Legislature to allow online voter registration.
Secretary of State Ken Detzner testified Wednesday that he's fearful that there will be problems if the state tries to install online registration by October 2017.
There are bills moving in the House and Senate that would require Florida to join 20 other states that already offer registration online.
Detzner contended that not much planning or “thought” has gone into mandating online registration.
Senators pushing for online registration disputed Detzner's testimony.
Sen. Jeff Clemens pointed out legislators have been discussing online registration for two years. He said the bill allows the state to wait until after the 2016 presidential election.
Sen. Jack Latvala said the patience of the Legislature had been “stretched” on the issue.
