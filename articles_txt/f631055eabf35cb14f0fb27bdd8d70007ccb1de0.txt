City officials are looking to Washington for transportation funding.
Arriving at City Hall via the R train Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters he's joining more than 60 mayors across the country urging congress to pass a long-term federal transportation bill to help pay for subways, buses, ferries, roads, and bridges.
It's all part of Stand Up for Transportation Day.  
With Congressional funding at a standstill for the past six years, the mayor says support from Washington has not kept pace with the growing demand for improvements.
"The number's remained flat, while the need has gotten greater and greater, and our infrastructure gets older and older. Our counterparts, our competitors, are investing more and more.  Look at China, look at India, look at Germany, they're all investing. This country is not," De Blasio said.
"We have to do this, we have no choice.  But we have a hardheaded block that just feel that mass transit, all transit, shouldn't be funded by the federal government," said Senator Charles Schumer.
The current federal transportation bill is on track to expire at the end of next month.
