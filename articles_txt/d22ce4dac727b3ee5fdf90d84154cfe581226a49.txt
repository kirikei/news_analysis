SALISBURY, Md. (AP) -- A Texas energy company says it's shelving plans for a wind farm on Maryland's Eastern Shore amid opposition from state and federal lawmakers concerned about protecting jobs at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station across the Chesapeake Bay.
Pioneer Green Energy wrote to the Somerset County Commissioners last month that it was indefinitely suspending the project due to "unanticipated hurdles and roadblocks." Vice President Adam Cohen cited U.S. Sen. Barbara Mikulski's efforts to stall the project pending further study.
The 25-turbine project was championed by former Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley and environmental groups. But opponents said the spinning blades could compromise radar that tests the stealth capabilities of fighter jets.
The General Assembly is considering legislation to permanently bar wind turbines from much of the Eastern Shore.
