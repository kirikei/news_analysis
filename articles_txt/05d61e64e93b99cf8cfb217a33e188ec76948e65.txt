The IRS says more than 100,000 taxpayers have had their personal tax information stolen from an agency website.
Officials said the breach was part of an elaborate scheme to claim fraudulent tax refunds.
The information was stolen from an online system called "Get Transcript." The system allows taxpayers to get tax returns and other tax filings from previous years.
In order to access the information, the thieves cleared a security screen that required knowledge about the taxpayer, including Social Security number, date of birth, tax filing status and street address.
The IRS said it is notifying taxpayers whose information was accessed. The IRS is providing them with credit monitoring services.
The IRS has launched a criminal investigation. The agency's inspector general is also investigating.
