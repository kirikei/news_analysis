A six-player trade that would send infielder Alberto Callaspo from the Braves to the Dodgers and third basemanÂ Juan Uribe to Atlanta appears to be a done deal.
Fox Sports' Ken Rosenthal reported Callaspo; left-handers Eric Stults and Ian Thomas; andÂ right-handed reliever Juan Jaime are headed to the Dodgers in exchange for Uribe and right-handed reliever Chris Withrow, who is recovering from Tommy John surgery.Â Withrow could be back by the season's second half, according to Rosenthal.

The trade is subject toÂ approvalÂ by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred. Callaspo had previously rejected the trade,Â but will now waive his no-trade clause.
Callaspo, who is hittingÂ .206/.293/.252 in 38 games this season, was pulled from Tuesday night's game at Los Angeles.
Uribe, 36,Â is hittingÂ .247/.287/.309 with one home run and six RBIs in 29 games.
Stults, 35, pitched for the Braves on Tuesday in relief of starter Julio Teheran. The journeymanÂ lowered his ERA to 5.85Â with 3 2/3 scoreless innings. He could move into the back of LA's injury-depleted rotation.
Callaspo's $3 million salary this year is less than half of Uribe'sÂ $6.5 million price tag. Callaspo, as a player who signed as a major league free agent in the offseason,Â had the right to reject any trade before June 15.
