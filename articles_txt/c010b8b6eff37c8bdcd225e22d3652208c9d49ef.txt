PanARMENIAN.Net - Twitter is reportedly considering an acquisition of news aggregator Flipboard, Digital Spy reports.
The deal could be costly however, as the company is valued at over $1 billion according to Re/Code.
Twitter's CFO Anthony Noto has apparently been leading the discussions since the beginning of 2015, although both parties seem no closer to agreeing a deal.
The pair both face the same problem of increasing active user numbers and convincing investors that they can make money.
Flipboard's last public user count stood at 100 million "activated" users, while Twitter has 302 million.
In recent months, Twitter has also been focusing on other projects such as its Periscope live streaming app, which launched on Android on May 26.
