THEATER REVIEW
Clinton — The Musical
New World Stages, 340 W. 50th St.; 212-239-6200. 100 minutes, no intermission.
Turns out the dominant character in the Clinton administration wasn’t President Bill or First Lady Hillary, but Kenneth Starr.
At least that’s how it seems in “Clinton — The Musical,” where Starr steals the show as the Count Chocula of independent counsels.
It’s a pity he isn’t the center of this broad, profanity-laden satire. Even Kerry Butler, the comic force behind “Xanadu” and “Hairspray,” can’t do much with the mediocre material she’s given as Hillary Clinton — nice blue pantsuit, though.

Paul and Michael Hodge’s big idea is that Bill Clinton suffered from a case of split personality — so two actors play him. Tom Galantich’s WJ (for William Jefferson) is the serious statesman concerned about the economy while Duke Lafoon’s Billy is the saxophone-playing, McDonald’s-munching skirt-chaser.
Of course it’s Billy who gets in trouble with Monica Lewinsky (Veronica J. Kuehn), a half-wit easily manipulated by Linda Tripp (comedian Judy Gold).
Most of the humor is painfully dumb and crass, though you could argue that it reflects the go-go Clinton years and their randy figurehead. Tellingly, Lewinsky gets the single catchiest song, which features lines like “I’m f - - king the f - - king president/I feel like we just click/When I’m sucking on his . . . face!”

At least the focus on Clinton’s tawdry side means that Starr returns at regular intervals. Played with gleeful relish by Kevin Zak, this Starr is a kinky maniac who gets off on hunting down the Clintons.
Hovering about like an oversized buzzard, Starr lets out squeals of delight at the mere mention of Whitewater, and bosses around Newt Gingrich (John Treacy Egan), depicted as a gluttonous moron of epic proportions.
“Is Kenneth Starr gay?” WJ wonders.
“He certainly looks like he’s going to f - - k us,” Billy replies.
As far as this half-baked — hey, he didn’t inhale! — show goes, Starr does that, in spades.
