DURHAM, N.C. -- While in Indianapolis for the Fnal Four, some Duke students wanted to send a message about discrimination.
Members of LGBT clubs on Duke's campus passed out rainbow ribbons and stickers before the game.
It is in response to the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (RFRA) passed by Indiana's legislature.
When signed into law, many feared it would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians.
Lawmakers revised the law on Thursday, so sexual orientation and gender identity is protected.
Even though it changed, Duke students say they want to show solidarity for the LGBT community in the state.
"It's socially unacceptable to have these sorts of discriminatory laws in this day and age and so I think that as a Duke community, we're very supportive of progress and advocacy and we wanted to be a part of that in Indiana,” said Cameron Platt, a Duke student.
Students say discussion needs to happen to continue progress for LGBT rights across the country.
