The ex-San Francisco 49ers wide receiver, was drafted in the first round back in 2012, never caught a pass in his only season with San Francisco. Jenkins was traded to Kansas City prior to the start of the 2013 season, where he reunited with former 49ers quarterback Alex Smith.
In his first season as a Chief, Jenkins caught eight balls for 130 yards. In 2014, AJ started two games and finished with nine total catches for 93 yards, including a single catch for three yards against the 49ers.
In Dallas, Jenkins has a good chance at making the team, possibly entering the season as the No. 4 or 5 WR, playing behind Dez Bryant, Cole Beasley, Devin Street, and Terrance Williams.
Jenkins was part of the 2012 49ers draft class where only one of seven players selected currently remains on the team (Joe Looney). This will be his third team in four seasons.
