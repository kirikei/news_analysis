An off-duty U.S. Secret Service officer from the Uniformed Division was arrested Friday by District of Columbia police, according to U.S. Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary.
The officer had been assigned to the Foreign Missions Branch, Leary said in a statement.
CNN quotes an unidentified law enforcement official as saying the unidentified officer will be charged with one misdemeanor count of destruction of property.
Leary said the officer was placed on administrative leave and had his security clearance suspended.
An earlier version of the story erroneously identified the individual as as agent, not a uniformed officer.
