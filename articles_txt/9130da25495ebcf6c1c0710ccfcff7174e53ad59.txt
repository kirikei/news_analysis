IRVING, Texas — Hundreds of people have turned out to protest or support a Dallas-area city's endorsement of a bill in the Texas Legislature that critics say targets Muslims.
The Irving City Council on March 19 endorsed the plan by Rep. Jeff Leach of Plano, to forbid judges from using foreign law in rulings — which is already illegal.
Dozens of people spoke out Thursday night to Irving leaders.
Alia Salem, with North Texas chapter of the Council for American-Islamic Relations, says the community has endured death threats, plus ethnic and religious slurs amid the resolution.
Paris Bahcall, who supports the proposal, said Islam's goal is to, quote: "immigrate, assimilate and annihilate."
Leach singled out the Islamic Tribunal. The Dallas-area imams offer mediation advertised as voluntary, nonbinding and in harmony with the law.
