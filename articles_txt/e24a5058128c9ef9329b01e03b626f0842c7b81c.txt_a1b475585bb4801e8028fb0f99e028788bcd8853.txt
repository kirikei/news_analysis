CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving Â started Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals after missing two games with a sore left knee.
Irving sat out Cleveland's wins in Games 2 and 3 with tendinitis. He tested the knee during the morning shootaround and again before tip-off. The Cavs announced he would play about 30 minutes before the start.
The Cavs said Irving, who is now wearing a brace, will be monitored during the game. The Cavs have a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
In the opener, Irving scored 10 points and had six assists in 27 minutes. He only played 12 minutes in the Cavs' series-clinching win in Chicago on May 14. He tweaked his knee in that game and Matthew Dellavedova started the next games at point guard.
Irving has also been slowed by a sprained right foot sustained in the opening round against Boston.

The Cavaliers' star has improved to the point where he will suit up in Game 4 against the Hawks after missing the last two contests.
Cleveland Cavaliers All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving will return in Game 4 against the Atlanta Hawks after missing two contests with a knee injury, according to TNT's Rachel Nichols. Irving has been battling left knee and foot pain all postseason and it finally became too much after Game 1, but he will return to the court with the Cavaliers one win away from the NBA Finals .
Irving was listed as questionable before the game. The team's medical staff preferred he have "repeated good days" before letting him return to game action, which evidently has happened.
Irving earned Third Team All-NBA status after another superlative regular season, but has not been himself since midway through the Cavaliers' second-round series win over the Chicago Bulls . He played just 27 minutes in Game 1 of the series against the Hawks before sitting out. Backup Matthew Dellavedova has shined in his absence, nailing timely three-pointers and playing tough defense.
