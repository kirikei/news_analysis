The size of the 2016 Republican pack is starting to prompt hand-wringing in some circles. How can 19 or 20 candidates hold a one-hour televised debate?
Relax, folks — it’ll all work out. Politics is a messy business; the control freaks will just have to deal with it.
For now, the GOP (and political junkies of all persuasions) can enjoy a diverse field: two Latino senators, a famed African-American surgeon, innovative governors and imaginative legislators — plus gobs of ideological diversity, allowing for healthy debate over old party nostrums in a new era.
With the first “official” debate two months out, there’s plenty of opportunity to make a name. This is the Internet age, for God’s sake. Candidates can set up their own debates now, head-to-head or all-comers-welcome, via remote links. If the party poobahs or the media mavens don’t like it, too bad.
The chaos may also upset the plans of candidates who meant to focus only on Iowa and New Hampshire in the early going.
Tough. Times change; political processes must, too. Why should the fat cats of the “money primary” be the only voters outside the early states that candidates talk with?
The Iowa caucuses aren’t until February — more than eight months from now, six months after the first “official” debate.
That’s plenty of time for campaigns to adjust to a world where the old rules don’t apply. And it’s not a bad test for the surprises to come in the Oval Office.
Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina had it right, reacting to word that an “official” debate might feature only the top 10 candidates by stating, “I’ll look forward to making the cut and making my case to GOP voters.” Exactly.
It’ll all shake out fine in the end — and the shakeout will provide a fine contrast to a long, staged coronation over in the other party.
More choices are a plus for the voters — it’s the candidates’ job to make the best of it.
