The State Senate voted 37 to 4 on Wednesday to ban a common second-trimester abortion procedure that critics describe as dismembering a fetus. The bill now goes to Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, who has previously signed several anti-abortion bills. Under the bill, doctors cannot use forceps, clamps, scissors or similar instruments on a fetus to remove it from the womb in pieces. Such instruments are used in a dilation and evacuation procedure performed in the second trimester. The bill would ban the procedure except when necessary to save a woman’s life or in the case of a serious health risk to the mother. A similar measure in Kansas was signed into law on Wednesday.
