The clock’s ticking on whether SFX Entertainment can scare up another bidder to beat back founder Bob Sillerman’s latest offer to buy the 62.6 percent of the electronic dance music company he doesn’t already own.
Sillerman offered to take SFX private in February at $4.75 per share. The new offer — approved by the company’s board on Tuesday — upped the take-out price to $5.25 per share and valued SFX at $774 million.
Albert Fried analyst Rich Tullo, who called Sillerman’s opening bid “ an insult to investors ,” wasn’t impressed with Tuesday’s sweetener, either. But he does like the 45-day go-shop period, which would let a bidder with a better offer acquire SFX for only a $7.8 million termination fee.
The question now is whether another player has enough faith in music’s fast-growing EDM segment — with global revenue of $6.2 billion, according to the Association for Electronic Music — and Sillerman’s roll-up strategy to top $5.25 per share.
Tullo put the odds of a winning bid coming from AEG, Live Nation, MSG or another interloper with music interests at 20 percent. Otherwise, a company that Sillerman took public in October 2013 at $13 per share will revert to private ownership at less than half its IPO price.
