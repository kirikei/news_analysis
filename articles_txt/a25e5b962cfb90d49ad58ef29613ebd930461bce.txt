In a recent study published in the journal, Nature Genetics, an International team of researchers co-led by the University of Cambridge, have discovered a genetic mutation that can make one insensitive to pain.
Researchers in the study examined the genetic make-up of 11 families across Europe and Asia, who were affected by an inherited condition known as congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). They conducted detailed genome mapping and concluded that the condition was caused due to the variants of the gene PRDM12. The tested family members affected by CIP carried two copies of this genetic variant, which blocked the gene's function. This works by suppressing the development of chromatins, which are essential for formation of particular specialized cell types such as neurons. Here, the development of pain-sensing neurons is inhibited, which leads to the patient's insensitivity to pain.
These 'pain-proof' people have their own share of hardships. They can sustain injuries, burns and bone fractures which are often discovered too late and do not heal soon, just because they cannot feel any pain when these are caused. At times, such complications can even prove fatal.
However, findings from the current study could help affected individuals since researchers can provide appropriate genetic diagnoses and counseling for the individuals and their families. Even though no treatment is currently available, scientists can reduce the risk of serious injury and complications by means of supportive measures.
The researchers opined that PRDM12 is the fifth gene discovered until date, to be related to lack of pain perception. Two of the previously discovered genes are already undergoing clinical trials to develop new painkillers. Thus, this newfound gene too can contribute towards drug development, owing to the recent success that drugs targeting chromatins have achieved.
