The Daily Briefing
Your Right to Know
BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS — A federal judge in Texas on Tuesday angrily denied the federal government’s request to allow President Barack Obama’s immigration executive actions to proceed, even as an appeals court signaled that it might disagree with the judge when it takes the issue up next week.
Judge Andrew S. Hanen, of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, refused late on Tuesday to lift the injunction he had placed in February on the president’s immigration program, saying that to do so would cause irreparable harm.
The judge concluded that he “remained convinced” that the president exceeded his authority by seeking to allow millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally and obtain work permits.
