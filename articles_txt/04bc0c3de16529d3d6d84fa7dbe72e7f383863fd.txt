Here is the actual pardon document, via Townhall :
The key part:
Now, therefore, I, Chris Christie, Governor of the State of New Jersey, by virtue of the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution of the State of New Jersey and statues of the State, do hereby grant Shaneen Denise Allen, a full and free Pardon for all criminal charges and indictments arising from the arrest occurring October 1, 2013 to include the aforesaid crimes, and this order is applicable solely to said criminal charges and indictments, and to no other.
Police took Allen into custody for violating New Jersey law during a routine traffic stop when she informed the officer of the firearm in her car. Allen had a concealed carry permit from her home state of Pennsylvania to own the weapon.
When Allen revealed the existence of the gun to the officer without prompting, she appeared unaware of the vast differences between New Jersey and Pennsylvania laws, which created a legal gray area.
Her case also drew support from gun-rights activists because Allen obtained the gun for self-defense after being robbed twice.
A crowdfunding  page for her legal defense drew almost $75,000, three times the amount sought.
