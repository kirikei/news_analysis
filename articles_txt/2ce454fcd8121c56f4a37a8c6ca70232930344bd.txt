WASHINGTON (AP) — A political news website is reporting that a company owned by the Moroccan government will give the Clinton Foundation a donation of at least $1 million. That's in advance of a meeting hosted in Morocco in May by the charity.
The gift would add to the Clinton family charity's reliance on foreign contributions as Hillary Rodham Clinton prepares to enter the 2016 presidential race.
The Politico report cites unnamed sources in reporting on the donation to the foundation, headed by former President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea.
Responding to mounting criticism about foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation, the foundation said in February it would reconsider such gifts if Hillary Clinton runs for president. It is not clear whether any restrictions would apply to the Moroccan meeting.
