Matthew Dellavedova has been deemed a dirty player by basketball talking heads, but to Cleveland Cavaliers fans he’s a local hero.
Al Horford wasn’t happy about being kicked out of Game 3 on Sunday night for elbowing Matthew Dellavedova and Hawks fans are wildly unhappy with Matthew Dellavedova for essentially taking out two of their players. From the Kyle Korver incident in Game 2 to the Horford ejection in Game 3, Delly didn’t win over many fans in Atlanta.
He won over a ton of fans in Cleveland though, something that was evident in Game 4 of the Conference Finals.
When he entered Game 4, Matthew Dellavedova received a standing ovation from Cavalier fans ready to back up their favorite player.

Of course, there’s no contesting LeBron James as the most popular player in Cleveland, but Matthew Dellavedova has carved out his place as a fan favorite and someone that Cavaliers fans will defend to the death.
We’ve seen that a lot in the last 48 hours after Delly has been flamed for being a ‘dirty player’, and this was punctuation on that support. Cleveland fans love Matthew Dellavedova, and his fiery play os only to gain him more love and further make him untouchable in the minds of Cavaliers fans.
