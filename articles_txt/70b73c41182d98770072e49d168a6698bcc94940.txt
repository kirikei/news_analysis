Idaho Fish and Game Report Shows Wolf Population is Healthy 
The report found that average number of wolves in pack grew to 6.5 in 2014, up from 5.4 wolves in 2013.
The Idaho Department of Fish and Game released its 2014 annual summary of wolf monitoring this week, reporting 770 wolves associated with documented packs in Idaho at the end of 2014.
According to 2009 de-listing rule, a total of 150 wolves, including 15 breeding pairs, are required in order to keep gray wolves off the endangered species.
Biologists documented 104 wolf packs in the state, along with 23 packs in Montana, Wyoming and Washington that also roam into Idaho. 
Despite the animals' growing numbers, wolf harvest by hunters and trappers was lower in 2014 compared to the year before. Hunters and trappers took 256 wolves in 2014—100 fewer than in 2013. Fewer wolves were also killed due to depredation on livestock and predation on big game. The number of sheep and cattle lost to wolves in 2014 was below average for the past 10 years, numbering 43 cattle, 103 sheep, three dogs and one horse confirmed to be killed by wolves over the course of the year.
The report found that average number of wolves in pack grew to 6.5 in 2014, up from 5.4 wolves in 2013.
