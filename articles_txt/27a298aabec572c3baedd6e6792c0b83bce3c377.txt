COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The effort by leaders in Greenwood to get permission from the Legislature to alter a war memorial that lists the dead in world wars by "white" and "colored" appears to be stalled.
Greenwood can't change the plaques on its own because the 2000 law that removed the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome also requires a two-thirds vote from the state Legislature to alter any memorial to any war in the state. It was passed in large part to protect Confederate monuments during the anger over the flag debate 15 years ago.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Larry Martin says the bill is dead for the year. The Pickens Republican says discussing it would open an old wound.
Greenwood Mayor Welborn Adams vows to keep fighting to make the change.
