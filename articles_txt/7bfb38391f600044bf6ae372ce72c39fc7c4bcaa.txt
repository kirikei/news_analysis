His supporters have been working quietly behind the scenes since details of a pending indictment were leaked to reporters in early March.
The allies say they were inundated with requests to help once news of the indictments broke. They've since helped to coordinate numerous statements from local and national officials and launched a website: istandwithbob.com.
The site was paid for by the Menendez for Senate campaign committee and launched by a longtime Menendez adviser who managed his 2012 re-election campaign.
