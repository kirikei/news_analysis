NEW YORK – It&#8217s not like Hillary Clinton hasn&#8217t been in this position before.
She was the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 2008.
But the notions that this is her time, that the field of possible opposition is clear and that she has been thoroughly vetted just before could be her undoing, again.
There may well be far much more hurdles for her to overcome in 2016 than she and her supporters understand.
1st, the political culture has changed considerably considering the fact that 2008. Back then, each she and Barack Obama officially opposed &#8220same-sex marriage,” an problem that has changed the political landscape at light speed – becoming an intensely polarizing issue that has even challenged previous assumptions about religious freedom.
These days each Obama and Clinton assistance similar-sex marriage, both acknowledging that their views have &#8220evolved” over the years. Obama&#8217s public positions certainly &#8220evolved.” In 1996, as a state Senate candidate in Illinois, he filled out a questionnaire saying he was for it. As a U.S. Senate candidate in 2004, he was against it. In 2008, as a candidate for president, he was not only against it, but told interviewer Rick Warren on national television, &#8220I think that marriage is the union involving a man and a lady. Now, for me as a Christian, it&#8217s also a sacred union. God&#8217s in the mix.” But, by 2012, when he sought re-election as president, he was for it, once more. Final year he decided it was a constitutional suitable for same-sex marriages to be recognized in all states.
A single of his closest presidential campaign advisers in 2008, David Axelrod, wrote in his book &#8220Believer: My Forty Years in Politics,” that Obama was deceiving the public about his true position from 2004 by means of 2012.

What about Clinton? As president in 1996, her husband signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act, which was authorized by huge, veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. When did her epiphany occur?
It&#8217s not like sex wasn&#8217t a massive challenge for the duration of the Clinton years. She faces two significant challenges in taking credibly &#8220progressive” stances in 2016 – both relating to her own marriage and her steadfast &#8220stand-by-your-man” defense of her husband.
One particular supply close to the entertainment business is purchasing what are described as hours of telephone conversations allegedly recorded by a jilted lesbian lover in which an inebriated Mrs. Clinton supposedly trashes politicians and celebrities, which includes her husband. The opening bid for the recordings is $ten million. Whether or not their actual content will ever see the light of day is an open question. But would Clinton, already below fire for her erasing most of her emails as secretary of state, be capable to deal with the dropping of a bomb like that?
Some in the progressive and feminist community are angry with Clinton for her function in the cover-up of what they see as legitimate sexual harassment, womanizing and even rape, allegations against her husband. In an interview with Cause magazine in March, for instance, Camille Paglia had this to say about a Clinton candidacy: “[H]illary does not have it. Hillary is a mess. And we&#8217re going to reward the presidency to a lady who&#8217s enabled the depredations and exploitation of women by that cornpone husband of hers? The way feminists have spoken makes us blind to Hillary&#8217s record of trashing [females]. They were going to attempt to destroy Monica Lewinsky. It&#8217s a scandal. Any individual who think in sexual harassment guidelines ought to have noticed that the disparity of energy amongst Clinton and Monica Lewinsky was a single of the most grotesque ever in the history of sex crime. He&#8217s a sex criminal. We&#8217re going to put that guy back in the White Residence? Hillary&#8217s ridden on his coattails. This is not a lady who has her personal career, who&#8217s produced her own career! The lady who failed the bar exam in Washington. The only cause she went to Arkansas and got a job in the Rose law firm was because her husband was a politician.”
It could get rough out there – and Clinton has even extra baggage.
What individual pretty much specific not to be present at Clinton&#8217s official announcement today is Huma Abedin. The appealing Abedin has been a continual companion with Clinton for almost two decades, beginning as a White Property intern in 1996. Since then she has held positions as Mrs. Clinton&#8217s chief of employees and &#8220body woman” during Clinton&#8217s 2008 Democratic presidential campaign, as deputy chief of employees to her as secretary of state and now operates for the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation.
This relationship survived in spite of Abedin&#8217s marriage to former Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, whose profession imploded when he was forced to admit he had texted sexually explicit photographs of himself to at least six various ladies, a truth he had previously denied. It also survived Weiner&#8217s ill-fated bid to grow to be mayor of New York in the wake of the scandal.
Extra remarkably, the connection in between Clinton and Abedin also survived revelations that the latter has in depth family members ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, the wide-ranging network that birthed both al-Qaida and ISIS and whose organizations mission is &#8220destroying Western civilization from within.” But it gets worse.
When Clinton employed an insecure private e-mail account exclusively as secretary of state, she officially prohibited other State Division staff from undertaking so. But, Abedin, as deputy chief of staff, also violated the policy. Judicial Watch has filed suit in federal court for access to these emails.
Abedin is also certain to receive more scrutiny more than disclosures  that private consulting firm Teneo, exactly where Doug Band, former &#8220body man” and advisor to former President Bill Clinton is president and Bill Clinton is a board member, paid Huma $335,000 as a consultant working a second job when she was also a aspect-time consultant to the State Department, earning $135,000 as a government employee.
Then, of course, there&#8217s the ongoing investigation of her role in the Benghazi disaster.
Bigger than Watergate! Larger than Iran-Contra! Ten times bigger than each, Rep. Steve King has said. &#8220The Actual Benghazi Story: What the White Property and Hillary Don&#8217t Want You to Know” (Autographed)
No doubt the part her husband would play in a second Clinton administration would be a nagging query. Bill Clinton normally alluded to his wife&#8217s part as a type of co-presidency, with the former president gleefully proclaiming the voting public would &#8220get two for a single” with a vote for him.
But there&#8217s however additional trouble in paradise.
Nevertheless brewing for Bill Clinton is the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and the rumored $3.5 million contribution Epstein sent from a Swiss bank account to Bill and Hillary&#8217s foundation after allegations of Bill&#8217s involvement in Epstein&#8217s pedophile &#8220Orgy Island” became public earlier this year.
Then there are the innumerable foreign contributions produced to the Clinton Foundation, like some made by foreign lobbyists when Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state.
Will it truly be a smooth ride to the Democratic Celebration presidential nomination this time?
How about the White Residence?
