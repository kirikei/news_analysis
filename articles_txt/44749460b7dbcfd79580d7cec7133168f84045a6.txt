Carly Fiorina thinks Apple’s Tim Cook is a hypocrite on gay rights
Former HP Chief thinks Cook's opposition to Indiana's Religious Freedom Act is misguided
“When Tim Cook is upset about all the places that he does business because of the way they treat gays and women, he needs to withdraw from 90% of the markets that he’s in, including China and Saudi Arabia. But I don’t hear him being upset about that.”
– Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, regarding the Apple CEO’s public stance on Indiana’s anti-gay, religious freedom law , during an interview Thursday with the Wall Street Journal. Fiorina, a conservative Republican, feels that there is “nothing objectionable” about the Indiana law. “I think this is a ginned-up controversy by people who play identity politics that has divided the nation in a way that is really unhelpful,” she said.
Fiorina, regarded as one of the worst tech CEOs of all time, is considering a bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
