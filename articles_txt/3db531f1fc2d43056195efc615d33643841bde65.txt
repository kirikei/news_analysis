FRIENDSVILLE, Md. (AP) — The Garrett County Commissioners say they want an objective study of the potential economic impact of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas in western Maryland.
The Cumberland Times-News ( http://bit.ly/1GHFEkS ) reports that board members expressed support for such a study Monday after hearing from some businesses near Deep Creek Lake that depend largely on tourism and second-home buyers.
An economic study done last year by Towson University said there is a dearth of usable data about the impact of fracking in tourist areas
Commissioners Chairman Paul Edwards says the board is trying to find the money to fund a study.
