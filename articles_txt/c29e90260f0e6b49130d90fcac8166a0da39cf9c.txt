SCHOOL TESTS
Lawmakers in both chambers start work on a smattering of proposals aimed at reducing standardized school tests. The proposals range from reducing statewide tests to federal minimums (in Senate Education Thursday) to reducing tests in early grades and for high school juniors and seniors (in House Education Monday). It's far too soon to say which testing-related bills will make it to the governor's desk, but there appears to be broad bipartisan consensus that some testing tweaks are needed.
