I've read and heard a lot about the Trans Pacific Partnership and have come to the horrible conclusion that this latest trade deal won't create any jobs. In fact, a lot of us are probably going to have to take a pay cut to compete with workers in Vietnam and Malaysia.
You'd think this would be enough to kill the deal, but instead they want to fast-track it. That means Congress would have to give a thumbs up or thumbs down without offering any changes, and before they even know what's in the bill. Does that sound like a good idea?

They don't want an open debate because they can't support their claim that this new trade deal would create 650,000 jobs. The Washington Post looked into it and it turns out the real number of jobs we'd end up with is closer to zero. Zero jobs. I'm creating zero jobs writing this letter, and it didn't take an act of Congress.
The worst part is that some of us will undoubtedly suffer. Who wins if you and I have to compete with Vietnamese workers who make less than $1 an hour? Are we really counting on people there buying enough American-made cars to make up for the jobs we will eventually lose?
We can have a big discussion about whether free trade costs jobs and cuts our pay. The problem with fast track is there will be no discussion. We'd just have to trust that everyone in Washington is doing the right thing when it comes to sending our jobs overseas. You want to close your eyes and hold hands with Congress while we all jump off the cliff? I didn't think so.
