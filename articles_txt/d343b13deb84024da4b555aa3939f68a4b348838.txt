Civil rights leaders, ripping additional delays as “an insult to the American public,” known as Saturday for an instant vote on Loretta Lynch’s U.S. lawyer common nomination.
“We’re not asking for favors,” the Rev. Al Sharpton mentioned at a rally at the Harlem headquarters of the National Action Network. “We’re not asking for backroom offers. Get in touch with the vote.”
Lynch, the U.S. lawyer in Brooklyn, is broadly believed to have the essential 51 votes. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has delayed any vote, insisting that sex trafficking legislation desires to be addressed by Democrats just before her confirmation.
McConnell’s stance remains the lone hurdle to Lynch’s replacement of outgoing Lawyer Basic Eric Holder.
