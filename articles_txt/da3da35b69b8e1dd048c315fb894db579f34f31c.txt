Did Melgen return the favors for Menendez’s alleged lover?
The Sal Melgen Foundation paid $39,961 for “two beneficiaries” to attend the University of Miami, according to the foundation’s 2009 tax filings.
One of those students was Melgen’s own Brazilian girlfriend, according to a federal indictment against Menendez and Melgen unsealed last week.
The identity of the other student remains unknown.
At the same time the Melgen Foundation was funding the Brazilian student, the daughter of a woman linked to the Democratic senator attended the same university.
Fatima Reynolds, 28, was studying in the University of Miami’s school of communication, according to articles she wrote in 2008 as part of a student journalism project.
Reynolds’ mother, Cecilia, a married newspaper publisher in Freehold, NJ, was allegedly involved in a romantic relationship with the Democratic US senator.
Fatima and Cecilia Reynolds did not return calls seeking comment.
