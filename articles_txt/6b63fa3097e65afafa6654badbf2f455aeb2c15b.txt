Praise continues to pour in for the improved and reformed Johnny Manziel, and the proof is on the field.
Manziel took snaps with the second team May 26 as the Browns began Organized Team Activities for the second year under coach Mike Pettine. Earlier this month, Pettine said Manziel was dividing reps evenly with Connor Shaw and Thad Lewis.
Its just a coachs decision based on how those guys came out of Phase Two, said Pettine, referring to the offseason program before the start of OTAs. I dont want to get into grading specific plays today. I have a little better feel for it now, having been in a lot of those meetings. Hes been very engaged in the meetings. Its good to see a lot of stuff carried over from the meetings out onto the field, and not just for him but for all the quarterbacks.
I just feel much better  from that room a better sense of urgency and much more attention to detail.

Manziel has not met with the media since the day after the 2014 season ended. He checked into the Caron Addiction Treatment Center in Pennsylvania on Jan. 28 and stayed there for 70 days. Players who were around Manziel last year say he is a different player now.
We dont really have to say anything, safety Donte Whitner said after practice. Hes been doing that any way. I remember last (year) they made a big fuss about Johnny being in Vegas for Memorial Day Weekend. Johnny was here in Cleveland for Memorial Day weekend this year. So thats another step that hes taken.
Manziel is good friends with LeBron James. Whitner said Maverick Carter, James close friend and business adviser, is guiding Manziel as the Browns quarterback tries to get his life in order.
Hes taken a big responsibility in making sure that Johnnys doing all the right things, Whitner said. (Manziel) has a mentor, somebody to talk to, certain things that he really didnt have the ability (to do) or somebody to talk to before. It looks like its working out so far.
Manziel had a mixed day in practice, as most players did. He showed a nice touch on a deep pass to Rodney Smith. Another pass was behind Andrew Hawkins and picked off by defensive back KWaun Williams.
School comes first
Top draft pick Danny Shelton, a nose tackle, is not participating in the OTAs because Washington is still in class. NFL rules prohibit a rookie from attending OTAs before his school year ends.
Theres just no substitute for being in the meetings and being around your teammates and just kind of learning the ropes of the NFL early on, Pettine said. You just cant substitute that. I wouldnt say its going to put him behind tremendously. Hell have access to all the stuff that were doing, from a playbook standpoint. Its one of those rules. Its tough, those guys that are really at a disadvantage that are at those quarter-system schools.
Shelton signed a four-year contract earlier this month.
Notes
Rookie running back Duke Johnson was absent from camp because of travel issues from Miami, Pettine said. ... Linebacker Craig Robertson is stuck in Houston because of the flooding in Texas.  Linebacker Barkevious Mingo is recovering from shoulder surgery and wore a red jersey to signify no contact.  Defensive lineman Phil Taylor wore a brace on his right knee and practiced lightly. ... Free safety Tashaun Gipson is still working out on his own in Dallas because he is unhappy with his contract situation. Jordan Poyer replaced Gipson with the first team.
