McCain said:
“With a full heart, I ask Arizonans again for their support as I seek re-election to the United States Senate. I’m as determined as ever to deserve your trust and grateful as ever for the privilege.”
Despite the fact that McCain will be 80 years old when the election day rolls around, the Arizona Republican is more than confident that his age will not hold him back.
McCain told the Associated Press:
“I work 16-hour days. Look at what I’ve done for Arizona and America.”
“Make your own judgment.”
