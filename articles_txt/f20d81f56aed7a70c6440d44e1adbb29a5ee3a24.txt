CHICAGO (AP) — U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin has met with officials in Ukraine to offer his support in their fight against pro-Russian rebels.
The Illinois Democrat already met with Ukraine's prime minister, president and other leaders. And he was also scheduled to visit a site on Tuesday where 300 U.S. military personnel are training Ukrainian soldiers.
A statement from Durbin's office quotes him saying Ukraine is "fighting the illegal seizure of Ukrainian territory by Russian-backed separatists." And he says "America's relationship with Ukraine has never been more important."
The statement says that Durbin will travel on to Poland and Lithuania. Durbin's mother was born in Lithuania and he has expressed concern previously about Russia's potential impact on the security of all three Baltic countries.
