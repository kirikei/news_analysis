Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan believes that lawmakers in Annapolis are a long way from finishing up on a budget that he could sign.
So he took action on Monday, signing an executive order extending the legislative session. The state constitution allows the governor to order an extension of the session of up to 10 days if it has reached the 83rd day of its projected 90-day session and a budget hasn't been passed. The move is fairly routine, observers say, but it comes at a time when the Republican Hogan and the Democratic-controlled legislature aren't seeing eye to eye.
Earlier Monday, Hogan told the Associated Press that he hoped to work out a solution by the 90th day of the session, April 13, but claimed that he was elected because voters want more fiscal responsibility and tax relief, but that some in the legislature "havenât quite gotten that message yet."
No business other than the budget can be done during the extension.
