ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — A pair of bills signed into law by New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez are designed to give a boost to the state's already booming film industry.

Television productions currently qualify for a 30 percent tax rebate on direct expenditures if they film at least six episodes. The new law would allow pilots to receive that level of rebate.
