WASHINGTON — School kids still would take annual standardized tests but states would have much more control in how the results are used to scrutinize schools under a bipartisan plan to update the No Child Left Behind education law announced Tuesday by two key senators.
“We have found remarkable consensus about the urgent need to fix this broken law, and also on how to fix it. We look forward to a thorough discussion and debate in the Senate education committee next week,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, in a joint news release issued with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the panel’s senior Democrat.
Murray said there’s more work to be done, but the agreement is a “strong step in the right direction.”
The White House, in a statement, called the agreement an “important step in their bipartisan effort.”
The Senate agreement comes in contrast to a partisan stalemate in the House, where a vote on a GOP-crafted bill to update the Bush-era law was abruptly canceled in February amid opposition from conservatives concerned that it would continue too strong a federal role in education.
The senators announced a hearing for Tuesday to debate their proposal, on which Alexander and Murray have worked behind closed doors for months. Among the issues they’ve grappled with is whether to maintain requirements that all students be tested annually in reading and math in grades three through eight and again in high school. Their plan keeps those requirements but allows states to determine the weight of those tests in how they judge schools.
The House bill also kept the testing requirements.
