CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — A Nevada proposal requiring parental notification before a minor can receive an abortion will be downgraded from a bill to a study.
Republican Assembly Speaker John Hambrick said Monday that AB 405 won't go forward this session, but he wants a committee to examine the matter when the session ends.
The bill would require physicians to send a written notification to parents or guardians of a minor seeking an abortion and requires a 48-hour wait time before the procedure.
Republican Assembly Majority Leader Paul Anderson said the bill could cost courts more than $2 million, and said there wasn't enough time to properly vet the proposal.
Nevada voters approved a referendum in 1990 giving women the ability to undergo an abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy.
