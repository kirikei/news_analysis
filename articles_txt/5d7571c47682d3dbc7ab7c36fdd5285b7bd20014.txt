In this Florida legislative session, one item that should be front and center is the "corrections" to the Florida Department of Corrections. The department's new secretary, Julie Jones, seemed to be prepared to take the bull by the horns, and would clean up a truly dysfunctional department with a budget of more than $2 billion.
It is a department in disarray from physical abuse (if not murder), substandard health care, unsafe vehicles, buildings falling down, employee unrest after years without raises and understaffing. These problems will lead to disaster when the primary objective is to house and care for humans.
I can tell you the abuse reports are true. I was assaulted by a guard within 15 minutes of being in custody of DOC and deprived of blood pressure medication for more than a week.
I now consult with inmates' families who describe much worse abuses. These are systemic problems: poor employee morale, dysfunctional management and — even more dangerous — a few rouge officers guilty of abusing those in their care without fear of reprisal or consequences.
I'd like to offer solutions that could be implemented immediately:
• Freeze the privatization of prison facilities and health care of inmates. This cannot be a for-profit endeavor, as our police forces and armed forces cannot.
• Create more work camps and work release centers for all eligible inmates, as this is revenue-generating and part of the re-entry process.
• Contract a nonprofit medical group to examine inmates in DOC custody to document and baseline the overall health of said inmates. The group's report should go directly to the secretary, with copies to the House and Senate oversight committee chairs.
• Use inmate labor to repair the facilities and vehicles. There are inmates eager to use their trades. Use a facilities manager, answering to the secretary's office and bypassing the normal red tape to acquire the parts or supplies needed to complete the repairs.
• Reinstate proper staffing levels using retired military, federal, state and county correctional officers until such time as funding and proper training re-establishes accepted institutional levels. Create a hot line — similar to Crime Stoppers — to report abuse.
• Prosecute the rogue officers and those who cover up the incidents or lie to investigators, as you would in open society.
• Establish a contraband K-9 search of all inmates, civilians, contractors, guards and administrative personnel entering all DOC prisons. This will greatly reduce contraband and decrease prison problems.
• Establish trade schools at every prison offered to every eligible inmate with enough time to complete the program.
• Offer a faith-based re-entry program taught by volunteers to every inmate prior to release. This will dramatically reduce the readmission rate, saving the taxpayers money. Inmates need a re-entry plan.
These are just a few ideas to start improving DOC.
Those inside DOC who wish to help inmates are suppressed by low pay, bad morale, poor management, budget mismanagement and a lack of resources.
The actions of rogue officers take a toll on the good officers and civilians who want to do the job right.
Human beings are being abused and sometimes killed, and this must stop.
Thank you to the reporters and legislators for their courage in taking up the unpopular story of inmate abuse and neglect.
