Gov. Cuomo has declared a state travel ban to Indiana.
"Today, I direct all agencies, departments, boards and commissions to immediately review all requests for state-funded or state-sponsored travel to the State of Indiana and to bar any such publicly funded travel that is not essential to the enforcement of state law or public health and safety," Cuomo said in a press release. "The ban on publicly funded travel shall take effect immediately."
Indiana recently passed a "religious freedom" law that could discriminate against gays and lesbians. 
"New York State has been, and will continue to be, a leader in ensuring that all LGBT persons enjoy full and equal civil rights," Cuomo's remarks continued. "With this action, we stand by our LBGT family members, friends and colleagues to ensure that their rights are respected."
