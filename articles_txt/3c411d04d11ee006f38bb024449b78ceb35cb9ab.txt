Malia Obama is all grown up and driving, and we already know who didn’t teach her to drive — her parents.
Last year, the first lady told Michael Strahan in an interview that, due to security measures, it was out of the question. “I think our agents don’t want us driving with teenagers,” Obama said. “So they want to keep us, you know — especially the president’s detail. I don’t think they want him in the state when she’s learning how to drive. We will fortunately be able to hand that responsibility over to someone else.”
So, who exactly, did teach her?
“The Secret Service, actually, because they wouldn’t let me in the car with her,” Michelle Obama told Rachael Ray. “Driving for Malia, I think, gives her a sense of normalcy, like the rest of her friends are doing. And my kids have got to learn how to live in the world like normal kids.”
The episode airs Thursday.
No, one of them is not that show is coming back before the fall. Sorry.
