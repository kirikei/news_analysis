Download Periscope for Android from Google Play. So if you turn off alert for when followed users go live, you won’t be alerted if any of the folks you follow start broadcasting.
Some uses seem harmless enough: People are using Twitter-owned Periscope, or competitor Meerkat, to show video of travel, landmarks, how-tos. Her team was presented with the challenge of adjusting the Periscope app with different types of screens. Android users get a more precise set of notification settings, including the ability to only be notified of a friend’s first Periscope broadcast and no further posts.
Is there anything else new?
A third screen also present you with popular users, which are determined by the usual metric of how many likes/hearts/favs they’ve received. The app exploded onto the scene only days after its rival Meerkat scored $12 million of Venture Capital funding, and quickly became a ubiquitous sight on Twitter (at least, it did for early adopters and journalists). Both apps began as iOS-only services, connect to your Twitter account, and allow you to tweet links to your live stream. Periscope users who viewed the fight effectively bypassed paying fees to rights-holders, making the app the newest wrinkle in the entertainment industry’s efforts to curb content piracy.
Wrong OutKast again. What do you get when Instagram, Snapchat, and Vine hook up and have an app-child?
The app is still being added to the Google Play store at the moment, but you can see the first screenshots of Periscope for Android courtesy of Mashable.
