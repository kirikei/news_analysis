COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A national environmental group has launched a $500,000 ad campaign against U.S. Sen. Rob Portman in Ohio claiming a federal budget amendment he introduced could undercut the enforceability of the federal Clean Air Act.
In spots airing across the state, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Moms Clean Air Force paint the Republican's proposal as a "polluter protection plan." It would have allowed states to opt out of new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards for cutting carbon emissions.
NRDC officials said Tuesday they've singled out Portman because his proposal "strikes at the heart" of an environmental law that protects public health.
A spokesman said Portman's pro-environmental record is strong and has received NRDC compliments.
Corry Bliss said the ads are aimed at promoting ex-Gov. Ted Strickland's 2016 bid against Portman.
