LaBrina McDonald"s frustration was potent Tuesday evening as she contemplated her son"s lost opportunity to continue his NFL career with the Bears.
Ray McDonald was arrested Monday morning in Santa Clara, Calif., on misdemeanor charges of domestic violence and child endangerment after an incident involving his former fiancee. His second domestic violence arrest in the last nine months prompted the Bears to release him.
LaBrina McDonald remained shaken by the developments.
"He"s learned a hard lesson about inviting certain people into his life," she said in a phone conversation. "He has lost his NFL career. And the thing about it now, he"s got to realize it"s not just about the NFL. It"s about his freedom, rebuilding himself and moving on " because there is life after the NFL."
Details of what happened before dawn Monday at the woman"s Santa Clara residence remain limited. What is clear is that the domestic disturbance and a subsequent call to police ultimately cost McDonald his job and the Bears at least a shred of public confidence.
Santa Clara police allege McDonald, 30, "physically assaulted the victim while she was holding a baby."
Audio of the 911 call related to the incident, obtained through the California Highway Patrol on Tuesday, features a woman identifying herself as the mother of the alleged victim. While not present at the residence, which McDonald leases, the caller asserted that her daughter was trying to escape with the infant while also claiming McDonald was drunk at the time.
The San Jose Mercury News obtained and published a non-redacted copy of the dispatch audio, in which the accuser"s mother also said McDonald broke down a barricaded bedroom door and tried to take the infant.
Santa Clara police are still investigating Monday"s incident. And, according to a police spokesman, the release of an official arrest report will remain on hold until investigators have enough details to pass on to the district attorney.
McDonald"s attorney, Steve DeFilippis, did not respond to the Tribune"s request for comment Tuesday but acknowledged to the Mercury News that McDonald was involved in an argument.
"But there was no physical contact," DeFilippis told the newspaper, "and if so, there was no crime."
LaBrina McDonald also insisted Ray has never hit the woman, suggesting that Monday"s incident was instead a ploy by the accuser to secure sole custody of the couple"s child. She said Ray"s driver witnessed the incident and could corroborate his claim of no physical contact. DeFilippis told the Mercury News about the driver"s presence as well.
While the 6-foot-3, 290-pound defensive end was released on bail from the Santa Clara County Jail on Monday afternoon, his one-year contract was terminated by the Bears.
The Bears remained quiet Tuesday amid a tsunami of negative publicity. The team returns to the field Wednesday for its first session of organized team activities and the Bears are expected to offer some public comment on McDonald"s arrest and their decision to release him.
That reaction may come from Chairman George McCaskey, who green-lit the March acquisition of McDonald after significant initial reluctance.
McDonald"s accuser in this case is the same woman who accused him of domestic violence last August, resulting in a separate arrest. Ultimately, no charges were filed in that case.
In December, McDonald was accused of sexual assault by another woman, an incident that led his previous team, the 49ers, to cut him. (Police have not yet closed the investigation into that matter.)
Still, when McCaskey reviewed McDonald"s file in March during the early stages of free agency, the Bears chairman admitted being troubled by "the pattern" and "the frequency" of McDonald"s missteps.
Ultimately, however, he changed his mind, swayed in part by an endorsement from new defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who coached McDonald in San Francisco for four seasons. McDonald"s own visit to Chicago to tell his side of the story further convinced McCaskey that he was a player willing to work to put his troubles behind him.
"God knows, if I had an opportunity to talk to Coach Fangio and George, I want to really thank them for giving him the opportunity," LaBrina McDonald said.
LaBrina McDonald lamented her son"s latest setback amid his efforts to meet the Bears" standard for staying out of trouble.
"He realizes that he should not have been there," she said. "I dreaded every time he was out in California."
