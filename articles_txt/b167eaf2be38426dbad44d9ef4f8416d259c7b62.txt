Sen. Ted Cruz, one of two declared Republican candidates for president, told National Rifle Association members in Nashville that he's fought the conservative battles, unlike his opponents.
"In a Republican primary, every candidate's going to stand up and say, 'I oppose Obamacare,' " Cruz said at the NRA's annual meeting Friday. "The question we ought to ask is, 'Great, when have you stood up and fought Obamacare?' "
"Every candidate is going to say they don't support amnesty. Alright, great. When have you stood up and fought to stop the president's illegal and unconstitutional executive action?"
Among contenders not in attendance was the only other declared Republican candidate, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who was not invited to the NRA meeting.
Cruz, a first-term senator and a Tea Party favorite, boasted about the Senate's defeat of several gun restrictions in recent years. He also recalled the recent letter that he and 46 other Republican senators signed and sent to leaders of Iran, which critics said jeopardized a nuclear deal between the nations.
"The Obama White House got a little hysterical about that," Cruz said. "I went on MSNBC on Morning Joe, and they went a little bit hysterical about that.
"They asked me, 'Do you regret signing that letter?' I said, the only thing I regret is that, like John Hancock, I didn't make my signature bigger."
