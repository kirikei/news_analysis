Simply because of that, Stutzman is no longer delivering flowers for weddings, which has cut substantially into her business enterprise.

But state Attorney Basic Bob Ferguson pursued the customer protection case against Stutzman, an action she says threatened her livelihood and retirement plans.

&#8220It&#8217s at time commitment and a personal commitment. I want to be their private florist,” she said. &#8220It&#8217s also a religious ceremony.”

She is married with eight youngsters, 22 grandchildren and three excellent-grandchildren.
Stutzman entered the florist business 30 years ago, when her mother purchased a flower shop and she started as a delivery individual.
