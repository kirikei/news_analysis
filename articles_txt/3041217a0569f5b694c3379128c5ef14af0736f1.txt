243 Bills Signed Into Law By Governor Tomblin
Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin signed 243 bills into law from the 60-day regular legislative session. Tomblim finished his work back on Friday.
"I probably vetoed a few more but I've had more bills presented to me this time," Tomblin told MetroNews last week.
The governor vetoed 32 bills, 17 over disagreements and 15 because of technical errors. The legislature corrected the technical problems on a dozen of the 15. Tomblin said the technical problems likely came from the new legal staffs in the House of Delegates and state Senate with the new Republican majority.
"That's been one of the issues we've had with a lot of new staffs. We've been able to correct a lot of the technical errors," Tomblin said.
The governor's staff spent the last three weeks working through dozens of page passed in the last few days of the session.
"We get a lot of bills dumped into our laps right at the end of the session, somewhere around 100, and I have three attorneys on my legal staff. It's rough on them, they've been working seven days a week," the governor said.
