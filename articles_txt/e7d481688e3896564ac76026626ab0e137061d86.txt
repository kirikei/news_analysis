A Nevada Assembly committee has passed a hotly debated bill that would require students to use bathrooms corresponding to their biological sex.
The Assembly Judiciary Committee voted on party lines to approve Assembly Bill 375, which was discussed earlier on Friday.
Republican Assemblywoman Vicki Dooling is sponsoring the bill and said it would require students in public schools to use locker rooms and restrooms based on their sex at birth.
She said schools would need to provide separate facilities for transgender students.
Transgender students and activists testified against the bill and said it would lead to more discrimination and bullying against transgender students, who tend to face higher rates of suicide and discrimination.
The bill now moves to the Assembly floor. (AP)
