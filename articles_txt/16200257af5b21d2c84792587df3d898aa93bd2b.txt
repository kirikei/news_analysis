It’s not quite a food fight, but you can call it a friendly food wager.
When the Cats continued their undefeated streak against the Mountaineers, Beshear welcomed a basket full of all things West Virginia. Saturday, another contest sees Kentucky’s top official betting a batch of Kentucky bourbons against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s basket of – what else – Wisconsin cheeses.
This time, even the Attorneys General are getting into the act, with Kentucky’s Jack Conway putting up a Meacham country ham against his counterpart’s Sargento cheese and Johnsonville bratwurst.
The Indianapolis face-off airs just before 9:00 PM on TBS and TNT.
