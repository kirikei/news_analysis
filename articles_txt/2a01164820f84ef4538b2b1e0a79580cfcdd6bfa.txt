Don’t expect Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to provoke the kind of media firestorm that has engulfed his neighbor to the south, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. That's because Mr. Snyder, a fellow Republican, seems almost allergic to hot-button political debates.
And yet, that aversion hasn't stopped the soft-spoken Michigan governor from carving out his own provocative niche inside the GOP as a Republican who often seems eager to stray from the party's conservative orthodoxy.
