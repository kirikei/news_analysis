New York • U.S. Senate leaders ought to straight away get in touch with for a vote to confirm Loretta Lynch as lawyer general, national civil rights activists urged Saturday.
The National Action Network, the NAACP, the National Urban League and other groups announced their campaign in New York, with the Rev. Al Sharpton saying they will go to the Washington offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell just about every day till he calls a vote.
"We're not asking for favors we're not asking for backroom bargains. Contact the vote," Sharpton said, prompting a chant of "Contact the vote" from a crowd gathered for the National Action Network convention.
Lynch seems to have a narrow majority in her quest to succeed Lawyer Common Eric Holder and turn into the first black woman to hold the job. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has said sex trafficking legislation need to be cleared before the confirmation vote can be held.
Sharpton cited the current fatal shooting in South Carolina — in which Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, was shot in the back by a white officer for the duration of a website traffic cease — as an instance of the urgent need to confirm Lynch's nomination. He said it was "an insult to the American public" that McConnell would delay the proceedings in light of the shooting.
"A prosecutor can make a decision what to pursue and what not to pursue," mentioned Sharpton. "It is with a sense of urgency out of Charleston that we get in touch with on now Mitch McConnell the head of Senate to give America a fair prosecutor to look at these circumstances."
Earlier this month, Republican U.S. Mark Kirk of Illinois signaled that he would vote to confirm Lynch, becoming the fifth GOP senator to assistance President Barack Obama's selection. Their votes, combined with assistance from all the Democratic senators, would give Lynch the votes she requires with no Vice President Joe Biden needing to break a tie.
"Loretta Lynch now has 51 publicly committed votes, which implies she has all the votes to be confirmed," stated National Urban League President Marc Morial on Saturday. "So when we say call the vote, we know that the vote is going to be yes in favor of Loretta Lynch."
Lynch, a Greensboro, North Carolina, native, has overseen bank fraud and public corruption situations in her current post as the U.S. attorney for New York's Eastern District, which involves Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island.
In the course of her very first tenure in the Eastern District, through the Clinton administration, Lynch helped prosecute police officers who severely beat and sexually assaulted Haitian immigrant Abner Louima.
