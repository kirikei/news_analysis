ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Republicans in Maryland's House of Delegates are criticizing Democrats who control the chamber for not bringing two of Gov. Larry Hogan 's supplemental budgets before lawmakers to consider.
Democrats argued Friday that the Republican governor's latest revised budget proposals undermine bipartisan votes that the House and Senate already have taken on the state's $40 billion budget.
Hogan and the Democratic-led Legislature are debating state spending, as Maryland's legislative session is scheduled to end Monday at midnight.
Democrats have restored about $203 million in education, state employee pay and Medicaid spending that Hogan did not include in his initial budget proposal in January. Hogan would still need to approve the money. However, the governor has criticized the Legislature for not doing enough to advance his tax-relief proposals.
