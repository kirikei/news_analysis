Christie's fortunes fell more than other GOP presidential hopefuls, report says
WASHINGTON — Gov. Chris Christie's presidential hopes have dropped more than any other potential 2016 Republican candidate, the Washington Post said Monday in its monthly ranking of GOP hopefuls.
"No candidate's fortunes have fallen as much as Christie's have," the paper said as it ranked Christie No. 7. In December, Christie was ranked second, behind U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. Paul was ranked fourth on Monday.
Christie was ranked fifth last month, behind former Florida Gov, Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Paul, who led the December rankings. At the time, the Post asked whether "Christie missed his window for running for president in 2012."
This month, Christie also slipped behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the Post's rankings.
