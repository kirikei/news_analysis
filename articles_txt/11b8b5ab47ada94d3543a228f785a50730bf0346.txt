The arrests come at a particularly bad time for the embattled Blatter, whose 17-year reign as FIFA's leader has been plagued by charges of corruption, bribery and a lack of transparency. The presidency of 79-year-old Blatter is being challenged by Jordanian royal Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, a reformist candidate, in a vote scheduled for Friday.
Blatter was investigated but is not expected to be named in the indictment. However, officials told CNN the probe is not complete, leaving open the possibility Blatter could be charged later.
The Justice Department has sweeping authority under federal law to file charges against foreign nationals whose only connection to the country might be a U.S. bank account. U.S. officials could also claim jurisdiction because American companies have paid billions to FIFA for broadcast fees.
FIFA's size and global reach may also help U.S. officials. The organization, which stages major soccer events such as the World Cup, is richer than many multinational companies, holding more than $1.5 billion in reserve.
