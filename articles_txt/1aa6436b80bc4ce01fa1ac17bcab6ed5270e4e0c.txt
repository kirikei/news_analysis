IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said he's confident the hackers are organized crime syndicates.
WASHINGTON — Hackers used an IRS online service to access information from more than 100,000 taxpayers, the agency said Tuesday.
"We're confident that these are not amateurs, that these actually are organized crime syndicates," IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told reporters.
The thieves got past a security screen that required knowledge about the taxpayer including Social Security number, date of birth, tax filing status and street address.
They accessed a system called "Get Transcript," Koskinen said — and the agency was alerted to the scam by an increase in the number of taxpayers seeking transcripts between February and May.
The IRS, which has launched a criminal investigation, said its main computer system remains secure.
"In all, about 200,000 attempts were made from questionable email domains, with more than 100,000 of those attempts successfully clearing authentication hurdles," the agency said.
The agency is determining how many fraudulent refunds were claimed using information from the stolen transcripts. Koskinen said less than $50 million was successfully claimed.
The IRS said it is notifying taxpayers whose information was accessed.
