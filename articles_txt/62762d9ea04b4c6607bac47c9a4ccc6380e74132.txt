State Sen. Ken Paxton, the Republican nominee for attorney general, celebrated his GOP primary win with supporters on May 27, 2014.
Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis has asked the Texas Rangers to look into Attorney General Ken Paxton 's violation of state securities law, Willis' office said Thursday. 
The move comes amid swirling questions around how Collin County prosecutors would handle the case, given the fact that Willis is a friend and business associate of Paxton's. The statement from Willis' office came a day after news reports that a Collin County grand jury was interested in Paxton's case. 
In January, the Travis County district attorney's office closed its investigation of Paxton without bringing charges, saying the office lacked jurisdiction. At the time, Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg said the appropriate venues for Paxton's potential prosecution would be Collin and Dallas counties, where he had admitted to breaking the law. 
While Paxton was running for attorney general last year, he was fined $1,000 for failing to register with the State Securities Board while soliciting clients for investment firms. 
The liberal Austin-based watchdog group Texans for Public Justice sought to jumpstart the case in Collin County on Monday, calling on Willis to recuse himself and appoint a special prosecutor. The group said the move was necessary because of Willis' relationship with Paxton. 
A Dallas-area attorney on Wednesday disclosed a letter purporting to show a member of a Collin County grand jury requesting information on Paxton from the Travis County district attorney's office.
