PASCO, Washington — Police arrested four people during a demonstration marking two months since the fatal officer-involved shooting of an immigrant farmworker in Pasco.
The Tri-City Herald reports ( http://is.gd/R97wFU ) that they were arrested after they refused orders to move from the street onto the sidewalk during a rally and march Saturday.
Protests have continued since three Pasco officers shot and killed 35-year-old Antonio Zambrano-Montes on Feb. 10, after they encountered him throwing rocks in a busy intersection. The killing was captured on cell-phone video and showed Zambrano-Montes running away from the officers, and then turning around with his arms outstretched, before they opened fire.
Police have held back from the protesters during previous demonstrations, but Police Chief Bob Metzger says this time the group became a threat to public safety by blocking traffic.
Among those arrested was Eddie Enriquez, 39, who has been involved in protests since the shooting.
