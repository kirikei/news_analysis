MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama lawmakers won't bar teens from riding in the back of pickup trucks after most acknowledged they've ridden there too.
The Alabama House of Representatives on Thursday refused to debate a bill to ban kids under 19 from riding in the back of pickup trucks.
Guntersville Republican Rep. Kerry Rich brought the bill following a fatal 2013 accident that killed four young people. The restriction would have applied only on federal and state highways.
Rich asked lawmakers if they thought it was safe for a teen to ride there.
Republican Rep. Terri Collins asked for a show of hands if they've ridden in the back of a truck. Most House members raised their hands.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says 30 states have restrictions on riding in cargo areas.
