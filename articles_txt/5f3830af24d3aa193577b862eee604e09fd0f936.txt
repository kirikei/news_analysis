NEW YORK — Electronic dance music promoter SFX Entertainment said Tuesday that it plans to go private, as Chairman and CEO Robert Sillerman will buy the company in a deal valuing SFX at around $490 million.
The company accepted an offer of $5.25 per share in cash from Sillerman, who owns 37.4 percent of SFX's outstanding shares.
The promoter behind events like the Electric Zoo, TomorrowWorld, and Rock in Rio said it expects to complete the sale before the end of 2015.
SFX's agreement with Sillerman allows the company to seek out other offers, and SFX said it plans to do so. It will pay Sillerman a $7.8 million breakup fee if it accepts a competing offer within 45 days, and $15.5 million if it accepts an offer after that.
The two sides valued at deal at $774 million including SFX's debt, its cash and cash equivalents, stock options and other items.
Sillerman offered to buy the New York company for $4.75 per share, valuing SFX at about $390 million, in February. At the time SFX shares had most recently closed at $3.30.
Shares of SFX Entertainment Inc. rose 88 cents, or 21.4 percent, to $5 in midday trading Tuesday. The company went public in October 2013 with an IPO that priced at $13 per share, and the stock was worth $7 per share a year ago.
