INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP) - The home of a former northeast Ohio politician imprisoned in a corruption probe is now controlled by federal authorities, who will sell it to recoup some of the costs of prosecuting him.
On Monday, U.S. marshals took control of former Cuyahoga (ky-uh-HOH'-guh) County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora's home in the Cleveland suburb of Independence. It includes a patio and outdoor kitchen area whose discounted construction was brought up in court.
The 59-year-old former Democratic party leader is serving 28 years in federal prison for corruption- and bribery-related charges.
The U.S. Supreme Court in October rejected Dimora's request to review his convictions. His agreement with prosecutors called for his wife to move out of the home six months after the appeals process ended.
She'll get half the proceeds of the sale.
