Obama tax returns.JPG
The White House released tax returns for President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden on Friday.
Does it seem like you're just not earning as much as you use to? Don't feel bad - President Obama is in the same boat.
President Obama and wife Michelle paid $93,000 in taxes on a gross income of $477,383 last year, for a tax rate of about 19.6 percent, according to tax returns released by the White House Friday. ( You can see the president's tax returns for yourself here.)
That income is a drop from 2013's $481,098 and the lowest income since 2004, prior to Obama's election to the U.S. Senate. Most of the couple's income comes from president's $400,000 salary, plus $88,181 in income from book sales.
The President and First Lady also paid about $22,640 in Illinois state income tax.
The couple donated almost 15 percent of their income to 33 different charities, including $22,012 to Fisher House Foundation, a veterans-support organization, American Red Cross, United Negro College Fund, Habitat for Humanity and the Sidwell Friends School, where their daughters attend.
White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said the president's own legislation resulted in him paying more in taxes for 2014.
"As a result of (the president's) policies, the President was subject to limitations in tax preferences for high-income earners, as well as additional Medicare and investment income taxes," he said, adding a plug for even more changes.
"We need to close special tax loopholes for millionaires and billionaires, and invest in the middle class," he said.
Biden tax returns
Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, paid about $90,000 in taxes on adjusted gross income of $389,000, for a tax rate of about 23.3 percent. They paid an additional $13,661 in Delaware state taxes.
The Biden donated $7,380 to charity.
