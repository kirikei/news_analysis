A couple of months ago, Microsoft announced a deal with Samsung in which several of Microsoft’s apps would be bundled together with Samsung’s new phones. At that time it seemed like this was a deal that Microsoft only made with Samsung, but as it turns out it was just a prelude of what’s to come.
The Redmond company has recently announced that their app bundle deal will now extend to more Android OEMs. This means that Microsoft will include apps such as their Office suite on Android devices, along with the company’s other products such as OneDrive and Skype, presumably with the intention of spreading its ecosystem, even if it is on the platform of its rivals.
The company has announced deals with several  Android OEMs around the world, but some notable brands you might have heard of include LG and Sony, and to a slightly lesser extent Haier from China. Microsoft also confirmed that the upcoming LG tablet would be getting the apps and the current Sony Xperia Z4 would receive these apps in the next 90 days.
According to Microsoft, “We are excited that each of these partners will make our services available on their Android tablets, and we look forward to extending agreements to even more partners in the future.”
