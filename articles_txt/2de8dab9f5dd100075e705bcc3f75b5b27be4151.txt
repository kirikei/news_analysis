PITTSBURGH "혬 From the time he was drafted by the Steelers a dozen years ago, fans have posed questions for Ben Roethlisberger every day. Along with the usual requests for autographs and photos, a new favorite has emerged: "How many pounds per square inch do you like inflated in a football?"
After the controversy surrounding Patriots star QB Tom Brady and deflategate, PSI has become quite the topic of conversation. But Roethlisberger said he doesn't have a preference in game balls whether it's 13 (legal) or illegal (11.5).
"I have no idea," Roethlisberger said Tuesday after the Steelers' first day of OTAs. "Whatever they put it at, I play with it."
Roethlisberger said he's not even one who messes with the balls before games to see which ones he prefers. He just plays the game and has the utmost respect for Brady's game regardless. Though Brady is appealing his four-game suspension, he will most likely be out for the season opener against Roethlisberger's Steelers on Sept. 10.
"It's a guy that I've said for a long time is the best in the business, and he proved it again last year, wining his fourth (Super Bowl)," said Roethlisberger, who added that he hasn't been in contact with Brady. "If he's not out there, it's not the same. I have a lot of respect for him. On the football field, it's unbelievable the things that he's done. We'll wait and see what's finally going to happen."
No matter the outcome of deflategate, Roethlisberger said it shouldn't diminish what the Patriots accomplished.
