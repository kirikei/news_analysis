LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Las Vegans will know who won the Mayor's race later this evening. Polling places around Clark County closed at 7 p.m.
Results show 28,000 people took part in early voting with nearly 8,000 voting by mail, according to the Clark County Election Department.
The initial results show a nearly neck-and neck race between Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and Las Vegas City Councilman Stavros Anthony. Goodman has a slight lead.
A failed soccer stadium bid is at the heart of a challenge to unseat Goodman.
Voters in Las Vegas went to polls Tuesday to decide if the wife of former-mayor and attorney Oscar Goodman should be re-elected to another four-year term or if her challenger should take the top spot.
Anthony is a former Las Vegas police captain serving a second council term.
Goodman backed a partly publicly-funded downtown soccer stadium. Anthony has argued it shouldn't involve public funds. The deal ultimately failed.
Four people are running for mayor. The top two vote-getters will face a runoff in June unless one gets 50 percent of the vote plus one.
The City of Las Vegas doesn't include the Las Vegas Strip.
