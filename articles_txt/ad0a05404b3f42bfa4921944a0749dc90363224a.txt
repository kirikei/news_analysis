SACRAMENTO, Calif. --
Gov. Jerry Brown's office announced 83 pardons Sunday, according to the governor's office.
A pardon by the governor may be given to individuals who have lived exemplary and productive lives following their conviction. A pardon must be earned, officials with the governor's office said.
Ten people who committed crimes in the Bay Area earned pardons from the governor. Five of those pardoned committed crimes in Santa Clara County, two in the City and County of San Francisco, and one each in Contra Costa, Marin and Solano counties.
Officials with the governor's office said all 83 people completed their sentences and have been released from prison for 10 years or more. All have been free of criminal convictions in the last 10 years.
Each person obtained a Certificate of Rehabilitation, which is a document from a superior court stating the person who committed the crime is now rehabilitated.
With each pardon, records with the California Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are updated. The California Secretary of State and the legislature each have a record of the pardons,
which are public records, according to the governor's office.
