Actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger recently spoke out against Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act in an op-ed piece he wrote for The Washington Post .
Schwarzenegger said that as a proud Republican, he is furious at what he is seeing, and directs his message to certain members of his party.
“I know plenty of Republicans who are sensible and driven to solve problems for America. This message isn’t for them,” wrote the former governor. “It is for Republicans who choose the politics of division over policies that improve the lives of all of us. It is for Republicans who have decided to neglect the next generation of voters. If we want our party to grow and last, we must be focused on real solutions to problems Americans are facing.”
Schwarzenegger went on to say that there are so many other problems to be focusing on, including infrastructure, education, and air quality. But he worries that instead, the “distracting, divisive laws” like the one recently passed in Indiana are not only a danger to the country, but to the Republican party itself.
“If the Republican Party wants the next generation of voters to listen to our ideas and solutions to real problems, we must be an inclusive and open party, not a party of divisions,” Schwarzenegger concluded. “We must be the party that stands for equality and against discrimination in any form.”
