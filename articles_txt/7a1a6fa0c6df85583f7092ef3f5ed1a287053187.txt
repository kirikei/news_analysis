San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick had a cringe-worthy lapse in judgment on Tuesday when he made an Instagram post about the deadly floods that have been affecting the Houston area.
Kaepernick shared a photo of cars submerged in water and made a reference to a hashtag that he has been using to talk himself up. He quickly deleted the post, but not before Josh Sanchez of CampusSports.net captured a screenshot :
Here’s what the caption said if you can’t make it out:
“I warned you the #7tormsComing!!! #Houston #prayersup.”
The Niners travel to Houston for their preseason opener on Aug. 15. Kaepernick followed up with a tweet:
No disrespect intended! Prayers up!
The Houston floods killed as many as five people over the weekend and at least a dozen more were still missing as of Tuesday. It’s truly incredible that Kaepernick hit the send button on that post — even if it was only up for a few minutes — without realizing how idiotic it was. He really should stick to defending opposing quarterbacks on Twitter if he wants to create controversy.
