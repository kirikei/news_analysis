CHICAGO — The city of Chicago is considering paying out $250,000 to settle a lawsuit accusing police and prosecutors of a cover-up in the death of a man who died after a 2004 fight with a nephew of then-Mayor Richard M. Daley.
The city's Finance Committee will discuss the proposed settlement at its monthly meeting on Monday. It would still need approval from the full City Council.
Nanci Koschman filed the lawsuit in March of last year. It accuses police of concealing information and creating false evidence to protect Daley's nephew, Richard Vanecko.
Vanecko pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death of David Koschman and served a 60-day jail sentence.
The city's Law Department refused to discuss the possible settlement.
