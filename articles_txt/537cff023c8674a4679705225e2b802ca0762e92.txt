The wait is almost over. Hillary Clinton will kick off her long-anticipated campaign for president this weekend with a social-media announcement, probably on Sunday, a person close to the campaign-to-be told POLITICO — and will begin her 2016 run for the presidency with a trip to Iowa.
The announcement will be followed by a round of conference calls with staff, supporters and potential campaign donors to outline the theme of the campaign, which will focus on middle-class pocketbook economics and her role as a gender trailblazer, the person said. The timing of the announcement, which has leaked out to reporters over the last few days, has been the subject of hot debate inside the growing Clinton organization, and several sources have told POLITICO the Sunday launch isn’t intended to cast her as competition to Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who is announcing his own candidacy on Monday.

As POLITICO reported last month, the former secretary of state plans a quick tour of at least two battleground states, Iowa and New Hampshire, before settling into her new campaign headquarters in Brooklyn to begin the months-long work of setting up a field operation, communications shop and fundraising apparatus for a campaign that many close to Clinton estimate will raise and spend $1.5-to-$2 billion. Clinton has privately told her aides that she wants to avoid the coronation atmosphere of her 2008 launch and is trying to schedule what one person in her orbit described as “low-key” events where she will interact directly with voters — nearly seven years after her last appearances as a presidential candidate, when she lost to then-Senator Barack Obama.
Clinton enters the fray as the dominant front-runner for the Democratic nomination, with few potential primary opponents expected to challenge her outside of former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Clinton leads all of them by wide margins in preliminary polling.
