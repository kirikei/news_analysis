It’s boom time for Broadway: Overall attendance and grosses hit records in the 2014-2015 season, with 13 million people in the seats and $1.3 billion taken in at box offices.
“The combination of diversity of subject matter, different curtain times, different pricing all add to it,” said Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, the trade group that collects the statistics.
The 2014-2015 season, which ended Sunday, saw 37 new productions, including “Fish in the Dark,” the play written by and starring Larry David, as well as two musicals, “Fun Home” and “An American in Paris” that are both thriving after receiving 12 Tony Award nominations each.
Popular shows build word-of-mouth among audiences, which may have been a factor in ticket sales. Attendance this season was 7% higher than last, and 13% more than in 2012-2013, according to the Broadway League figures.
Part of the surge is due to an increase in the total number of playing weeks across all Broadway shows: The combined total of 1,626 weeks was an 8.7% increase over 2013-2014.
Though that season saw more new shows that opened, 44, it also had several early closures that left theaters dark or in transition, such as “The Velocity of Autumn,” “Let It Be” and “Bronx Bombers.”
This season had its flops, too, of course, including “Doctor Zhivago” and “Living on Love,” but it has also had “Fish in the Dark,” which has had full houses since it started previews in February. Its average ticket price has been consistently about $140, while the average ticket price across all shows was about $100, according to the Broadway League data.
With stars like Mr. David or Helen Mirren in “The Audience,” Broadway has steadily drawn audiences wanting to see film and television stars. But theater has also gained broader appeal in an era where television shows like “Glee” and “Smash” reveal the backstage drama of theater.
In addition, the recent revival of live theater on television, with NBC broadcasting small-screen revivals of “Peter Pan” in 2014 and “The Sound of Music” in 2013, have merged the industries.
“The interest of who is on Broadway and what’s playing on Broadway has become part of the popular culture,” said Ms. St. Martin.
The boosts in attendance and playing weeks this season came with a 7.6% increase in grosses.
Ticket prices ranged vastly this season, as in previous years. In the week ending Sunday, the average ticket price to the play “Airline Highway” was $48.45. At “The Book of Mormon,” which opened in 2011, the top premium ticket went for $477 in the week that ended Sunday, while its average paid admission was $177.30.

Ms. St. Martin cited the 900,000 more attendees this year over last as evidence that the increases in grosses can’t be entirely due to premium tickets. Programs like Family First Nights, which offers specially priced tickets for families, or 2-for-1 promotions like Broadway Week, facilitated by the city’s tourism arm NYC & Company, have widened the reach.
“We find that those people tend to come back,” Ms. St. Martin said.
