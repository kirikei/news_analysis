PARIS —  Here's guessing French Open security guards will not allow a selfie-seeker — or anyone else, for that matter — get anywhere near Roger Federer following his second-round match today.
Not after what transpired at the end of his victory in the first round. A teenager managed to make it out of the stands and stroll across the court to get to Federer, using a cellphone to try to snap photos.
It will be interesting to see whether there are any extra measures implemented at Court Suzanne Lenglen for Federer's match again Marcel Granollers, given the 17-time Grand Slam champion's criticism of security at Court Philippe Chatrier on Sunday.
"We need to make sure that it's safe out there and people don't just wander on the court like a free pass," Federer said.
Tournament director Gilbert Ysern's stance that day was there was no need to make any changes to protect players, but he did say: "For sure, we will reinforce the message again that clearly nobody is allowed to get on court in any case, at any time, for any reason."
The contest itself between the second-seeded Federer and the 57th-ranked Granollers hardly seems all that intriguing: Not only has Granollers never been past the fourth round in 30 previous major tournaments, but he's also 0-3 against Federer.
Here's a look at what else is happening at the French Open today:
MONFILS TAKES THE STAGE
Tennis' foremost showman, 13th-seeded Gael Monfils of France, plays on his country's biggest stage, Court Philippe Chatrier, against Diego Schwartzman of Argentina. Last year, Monfils wowed the crowd at Roland Garros the day before the tournament started by breakdancing on center court during an exhibition match. His running, leaping, diving shots are the stuff of legend around these parts — and there's plenty to see on YouTube.
CZECHS, MATES
Fourth-seeded Tomas Berdych, the Wimbledon runner-up in 2010, takes on his Davis Cup teammate for the Czech Republic, Radek Stepanek, who at 36 is the oldest man in the draw. They helped their country win the Davis Cup in 2012 and 2013.
SHARAPOVA'S COLD
After her first-round match, Maria Sharapova dispensed with the customary post-match, on-court interview and headed straight to the locker room, drawing whistles and boos from spectators. She explained that she didn't have much of a voice because of a cold that had her coughing throughout her win that day. On Wednesday, the defending champion faces another Russian, Vitalia Diatchenko, who is ranked 91st, 89 places below Sharapova.

The French Open 2015 live stream and TV schedule brings Day 4 on Wednesday as the top men’s and women’s players continue to compete. Two of the favorites for each draw will be in action including Roger Federer and the 2015 reigning champion, Maria Sharapova. They’ll look to continue their push towards another French Open title, as live streaming online and televised tennis coverage continues from ESPN networks.
According to USA Today in a May 25 report, Maria Sharapova was able to defeat her first round opponent Kaia Kanepi 6-2, 6-4 on the Phillipe Chartier Court. However, the two-time French Open champion received a chorus of boos when she refused to do a post-match interview for the fans inside the main court. Sharapova is reportedly fighting a cold and was said to have a “broken” voice according to the stadium emcee. The winner at Roland Garros in 2012 and just last year will next face fellow Russian Vitalia Diatchenko for the second round.
Meanwhile, the men’s No. 2 Roger Federer also had his own recent incident involving a fan at the tournament. The Swiss star won 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 against Alejandro Falla for the opening round just a few days ago. However, an ambitious fan stormed the court after the match looking for a selfie with his favorite tennis player. Security eventually ushered the young man off the court and reportedly there were no repercussions against the fan. Federer faces Spanish player Marcel Granollers for the second round on Wednesday.
In terms of the odds for the men’s and women’s No. 2 seeds, both are heavy favorites. Sharapova is priced at around -3300 on the moneyline, compared to +1400 for her opponent. Federer is a larger favorite at -5000, while his opponent is a +1600 underdog. Federer was listed fourth in terms of favorites to win the men’s championship, behind Murray, Nadal and Djokovic. Sharapova, the 2014 defending champion, was listed second behind No. 1 women’s player Serena Williams.
Wednesday’s French Open 2015 live streaming and televised coverage is scheduled for a 5 a.m. EST start in the United States. Viewers can watch it live on TV via ESPN2 on cable and satellite around the nation. In addition, there’s live streaming online coverage available through the ESPN3/WatchESPN broadband sports network. Live audio commentary is available for Sirius XM satellite radio subscribers on channels 93, XM 208, or internet channel 965 through the tournament.
