CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Lawmakers are considering a bill that would cut down on the sale or transfer of ivory in Nevada.
Democratic Sen. Mo Denis and others are sponsoring SB398, which was discussed on Friday in the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee. It would ban the sale or transfer of ivory but make exceptions for antiques in which the substance makes up less than 20 percent of the object, musical instruments made before 1975 and items passed down as an inheritance.
Proponents say the bill is important to curb poaching and prevent elephants from going extinct on account of their tusks.
Opponents included gun rights groups, who said the bill would strip the value from lawfully purchased items that contain ivory. The materially was historically used in gun grips and knife handles.
