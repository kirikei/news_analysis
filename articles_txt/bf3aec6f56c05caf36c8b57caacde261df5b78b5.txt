A Washington state florist has found support after she refused to provide flowers to a same-sex couple. 
Barronelle Stutzman, owner of Arlene's Flowers and Gifts, was fined $1,000 by the Benton County Superior Court in March.  The case and fine stem from Stutzman's refusal to serve a same-sex couple in 2013, The  Seattle Times  reported. 
When word got out that the 70-year-old woman was fined, supporters set up a  GoFundMe  page to help her out and as of Monday afternoon, more than $103,000 was raised.  
According to the  Los Angeles Times , Stutzman had provided flowers for nearly 10 years to the gay couple for various events, but she cited her religion as a Southern Baptist as the reason she would have to decline the job for the couple's wedding. 
Stutzman's case isn't the first one where a business was financially supported after refusing certain business from a same-sex couple. 
Last week, a pizza shop was the beneficiary of more than $842,000 in donations from the  GoFundMe  site.
Memories Pizza's owner went on camera saying they would refuse to cater a same-sex wedding because of their religion, the  Los Angeles Times  reported.
