ANNAPOLIS, Md. — It would no longer be a crime to possess marijuana-related paraphernalia in Maryland, under a bill approved by the Maryland General Assembly.
The House of Delegates voted 84-52 on Saturday for the Senate bill, sending it to Gov. Larry Hogan.
Maryland decriminalized possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana last year. That made it a civil offense rather than a criminal one.
However, lawmakers didn’t do the same thing for paraphernalia like pipes, so the bill was introduced this session.
The measure also makes smoking marijuana in public a civil offense, punishable by a fine of up to $500.
