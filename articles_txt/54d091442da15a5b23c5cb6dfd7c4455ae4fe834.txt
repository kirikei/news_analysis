CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Nevada Assembly members are vetting a plan worth about $600 million that would permanently extend some temporary taxes and raise the cigarette tax.
The Assembly Taxation Committee held a hearing Tuesday on SB483.
The bill would make temporary rates on the payroll tax and sales tax permanent. It also raises taxes on cigarettes from 80 cents to $1.80 per pack.
The so-called "sunset taxes" were created in 2009 and lawmakers have temporarily extended them every two years. Gov. Brian Sandoval called on lawmakers to make the taxes a permanent part of the state's budget after years of relying on them to fund the budget.
