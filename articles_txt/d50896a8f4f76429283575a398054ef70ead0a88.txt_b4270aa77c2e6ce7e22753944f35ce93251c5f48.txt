With a little more than seven minutes left and the Cleveland Cavaliers up by 26 points, Matthew Dellavedova pulled off what his coach would later describe as one of the great shots in NBA history.
The coach, David Blatt, was being a little sarcastic.
But for the Cavaliers, Dellavedova's one-handed tap-in with his feet barely off the ground and an Atlanta Hawk hanging off his left arm was the moment Blatt, the team's leader LeBron James and the rest of the squad realised they were heading to the NBA Finals.
A party erupted on their bench.
"I think that came in a very, very memorable moment - maybe the greatest below the rim tap-in in the history of the game," Blatt laughed.
"He wasn't up over the rim, but he made it look natural and special just like that kid is."
Soon after Dellavedova sank that ordinary looking, but extraordinary to the Cavaliers shot, Blatt subbed his Australian point guard out and the delirious 20,562 crowd in Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena fired up a "Delly, Delly, Delly" chant that had been a regular feature throughout the game.
The Cavaliers won 118-88 and swept the Hawks 4-0.
Blatt revealed in the press conference Dellavedova was ill and probably shouldn't have played.
It explained why the coach rotated starting point guard Kyrie Irving, who sat out recent games with knee tendinitis and other injuries, in short bursts with Dellavedova.
"You know what, Delly could barely get off the bench today," Blatt said.
"He was very sick."
Just a few months ago the Cavaliers were looking to sign a back-up point guard to replace 24-year-old Dellavedova, who was born and raised in Maryborough, in country Victoria.
Today Dellavedova is one of Cleveland's favourite players, with a cult status among fans after three headline-making incidents in the playoffs.
Loved in Cleveland, it is a different story in Atlanta and Chicago, with Delly probably not safe to walk the streets without a security detail.
The first incident came when Dellavedova performed a wrestling-like hold on Chicago Bulls forward Taj Gibson and irritated Gibson so much he kicked Delly in the backside and was ejected.
The second came last Friday when Dellavedova crashed into the ankle of Atlanta's Kyle Korver and inflicted a sprain so severe Korver's season was over and he'll have surgery later this week.
Then on Sunday Dellavedova became tangled with Hawk Al Horford who lashed out when he believed the Australian had purposely targeted his knees.
Debate raged across America about whether Delly was a dirty player.
The consensus was he just played hard.
One thing that isn't up for debate - Dellavedova is one of the NBA's rising stars.
A rap song has been written about him.
His singlet sales have skyrocketed.
In the past month his @MatthewDelly Twitter followers have increased 50 per cent.
In the five-month regular season he was mentioned on Twitter 45,000 times, but on the day of the Horford incident he was mentioned 40,000 times.
After Atlanta were knocked out, Dellavedova, a slow-talking country Victorian lad who was once described by Australian Olympic coach Brett Brown as "Neanderthal", explained in his usual low key way how he's been able to handle the attention.
"I have great teammates and great family and friends," he said.

DeMarre Carroll had a sprained knee and turf toe, injuries that would’ve sidelined him for three to four weeks during the season. (Curtis Compton, ccompton@ajc.com)
By now you know the Hawks were drilled in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals 118-88 Tuesday night and were swept out of the series by the Cleveland Cavaliers. To go to MyAJC and read the column on the game, click here.
Here are my three “Short Takes” on the game.
1. THE REAL STORY ON CARROLL’S INJURY: DeMarre Carroll was ineffective at both ends of the court in the series because the Hawks said he was playing on a sprained knee. In fact, the situation was worse than that. Carroll told the AJC he also developed turf toe so he could not put any pressure on his left leg or get any elevation. “That’s why I kept getting shots blocked,” he said. If the injuries had taken place during the regular season, Carroll said, he probably would have sat out three to four weeks. But surgery will not be necessary. Carroll will become an unrestricted free agent but left the door to a return to the Hawks, pending negotiations with them and other teams.
2. SHOOTING WOES: The Hawks’ three-point shooting continued to suffer Tuesday night. They were only 5-for-32 (15.6 percent) from outside the arc in Game 4, 26-for-111 (23.4 percent) in the series and 145-for-458 in the postseason (.317). This was one of the top three-point shooting teams during the season at 38 percent, led by Kyle Korver’s 49.2 percent. But Korver hit on only 35.5 percent in the playoffs before he got injured in Game 2.

Korver shoots 15% under in playoffs
Hawks get taken to 6 against two teams that won 25 games less than the Hawks
Hawks choke in 2 home games, in the playoffs, in games with 2 starters out on the opposing teams
Hawks lie about the severity of an injury to a starter for NO REASON AT ALL, then look like dumb arses when a teammate reveals it, and automatically alienate that player because he spoke the truth
The Hawks have the best record in their conference, home field advantage, and choke it away just like the Falcons did against Green Bay AND the NY Giants...the only teams that kick butt for homefield yet when the playoffs start, choke away all the toughness and good comments from others they earned by choking when it matters most
Beat writers stating that antic needs to be retained...are you kidding? Sefolosha needs to get healthy and they need to sign a true center that can rebound, or they won't make it back to the finals, EVER.
