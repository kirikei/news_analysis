2 top White House advisers are expecting babies
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama has called for more family-friendly workplace policies like childcare, flexibility and paid leave. And he has instituted 12 weeks paid maternity leave for his own staff.
Now those policies are going to be put to the test: Two of his most senior aides are expecting babies. That’s a rarity in the West Wing.
Communications director Jen Psaki and legislative affairs director Katie Beirne Fallon say Obama has pledged to support them as they start their families while working on his senior team. Psaki is expecting a daughter in July and Fallon is scheduled to give birth to identical twin boys in May.
