Perhaps Mitt Romney has found his true calling: bracketology.
Romney’s NCAA Tournament picksPhoto: Screengrab via Huffington Post
The former Massachusetts governor and once (and future?) Republican presidential candidate finished off a stunningly accurate set of NCAA Tournament predictions Monday night when his penciled-in champion Duke vanquished Wisconsin .
Romney had six of the Elite Eight and a perfect Final Four (including 7-seed Michigan state) and title game, in a bracket helpfully provided to the Huffington Post . ESPN said that put him in the 99.9th percentile, 6,326th out of 11.57 million brackets .
The political scion and private equity millionaire then made an out-of-touch Twitter joke after seeing the middle of his bracket come true.
Should have put $10,000 on my bracket. Congrats, Coach K and @DukeU .
Just a casual 10G wager, ya know? Romney declined to fill out a bracket in 2012, saying he was too busy running to become the Republican Party’s (unsuccessful) nominee.
On the other side of the aisle, President Obama had Duke (check), Kentucky (check), Arizona (nope), Villanova (not even close) in the Final Four, with the chalk pick Kentucky going all the way.
