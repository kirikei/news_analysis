WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Secret Service officer was arrested by police in Washington on Friday, the agency said in a statement.
The officer, Arthur Baldwin, was charged with destruction of property and burglary, said D.C. Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump.
Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy has ordered that the officer's security clearance be suspended and that he be placed on administrative leave, the statement said.
The officer was assigned to the Secret Service's Foreign Missions Branch and is being investigated by the agency's office of professional responsibility.
The arrest is the latest embarrassment for the agency that protects the president and his family but which has suffered a series of scandals in recent years.
It was criticized as being too insular by an independent panel appointed after a man with a knife scaled the White House fence and ran inside the mansion last year.
