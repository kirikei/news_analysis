Overview
Former World No 1 Roger Federer is looking for his first Grand Slam singles title since his victory in the 2013 Wimbledon and his second French Open title.
The Swiss maestro came through a comfortable first round match against Alejandro Falla and will take on Spaniard Marcel Granollers, whose best record on clay this season has been the R16 at Barcelona and Madrid, while Federer has won the Istanbul event and lost in the final of the Italian Open.
Meanwhile, Granollers, who has not had a successful 2015 campaign, will be hoping to cause an upset early in the tournament and if there is any surface that Federer is easier to negotiate then it has to be clay, where he has struggled in recent years.
