First Lady Michelle Obama got jiggy with it on stage at the 137th annual White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday afternoon. FLOTUS broke it down to Mark Ronson’s “Uptown Funk” with the “So You Think You Can Dance” All Stars.
The First Lady was on stage celebrating the fifth anniversary of her “Let’s Move!” campaign to battle childhood obesity, the theme of this year’s event with #GimmeFive. During her speech at the Easter Egg Roll, the First lady encouraged healthy eating and an active lifestyle to the 35,000 in attendance.
