BISMARCK, North Dakota — North Dakota's Senate has passed a measure that would allow people to carry a single-shot stun gun without having to obtain a concealed-carry permit.
The bill approved by the Senate on Tuesday is part of a package of sweeping pro-gun legislation.
The measure contains parts of a trio of bills generated in the House but the Senate added several amendments to the legislation. It now goes back to the House for consideration of the Senate's amendments.
Grand Forks Democratic Sen. Connie Triplett says she was concerned about removing the concealed-carry permit requirement for those carrying stun guns. She says they can cause injury or death.
Republican Sen. Kelly Armstrong is a Dickinson defense attorney. He says using a stun gun inappropriately can still result in criminal charges.
