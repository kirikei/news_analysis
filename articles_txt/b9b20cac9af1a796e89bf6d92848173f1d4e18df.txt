In an attempt to shore up his cred with Evangelicals, Texas senator Ted Cruz will be rolling out the first ads of his presidential campaign on Easter Sunday. Because, let’s be truthful, nothing says “presidential campaign” rather like the resurrection of Christ.
Cruz’s ad will air for the duration of the Fox News broadcast of Killing Jesus, an adaption of Bill O’Reilly’s very best-promoting book, and in “key states” throughout NBC’s broadcast of A.D.: The Bible Continues. Need to you dare, you can watch the ad right here.
Through CNN:
“The campaign is spending $33,000 on the 30-second spot, which capabilities Cruz speaking about the impact of the “​transformative love of Jesus Christ” on his life.”
Considering that Cruz announced his candidacy at Liberty University final week, he’s grow to be a single of the most vocal supporters of Indiana’s “religious freedom law.” On Friday, Cruz reiterated his assistance for the Indiana law to a group of Iowa supporters:
“There are a lot of folks here in Iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking watching what has happened in the final two weeks. We have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty.”
