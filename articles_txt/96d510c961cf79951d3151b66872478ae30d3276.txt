He only just started his second term, but New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is already looking ahead to a possible third term.
New York State Board of Elections records show Cuomo's campaign committee has changed its name to "Andrew Cuomo 2018."
A spokesman for the Democrat's campaign declined to comment Monday on the new name. The change was first reported by the Daily News, which also reported that Cuomo is holding a $15,000-a-person fundraiser in New York City on Tuesday.
Cuomo won re-election in November and hasn't said whether he plans to seek a third term. Until recently, Cuomo was widely believed to be eyeing a run for the White House in 2016.
