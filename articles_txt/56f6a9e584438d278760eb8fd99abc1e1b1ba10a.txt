Aside from engaging in bilateral talks, the Philippines should explore back-channel diplomacy to defuse tension at the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea), Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said on Tuesday.
“Diplomacy is not exclusively a government to government endeavor. There are a lot of Filipino businessmen with businesses in China and they have friends and connections there. Let’s utilize that, ask them to talk to their friends on how we can resolve this matter peacefully,” Marcos said in a statement.
The senator said the thrust of such back-channeling was to persuade China to stop its massive reclamation and aggressive stance in the disputed territories to give way for a dialogue to resolve the conflict.
Marcos earlier said that efforts should be done to strengthen RP-China relationship in the areas of culture, arts, trade, tourism, linkages between educational institutions, health and social protection issues, agricultural cooperation, and mutual assistance when natural disasters occur.
He said intensified diplomatic initiative on the part of the Philippines has become imperative now that the situation has become more complicated with Washington’s equally strong posture to assert freedom of navigation rights in the region.
Besides, Marcos said, the Philippines would be in the losing end if caught in the crossfire in case of a confrontation between the US and China.
“The end game of all our diplomatic efforts is to secure an agreement with China over the disputed territories in West Philippine Sea, that is what we should do,” the senator said.
Marcos also reiterated his call for Malacañang to summon the Chinese envoy in Manila to relay the Philippines’ desire for a diplomatic solution” to defuse the tension in the West Philippine Sea.
Just last month, Marcos wanted the President to summon the Chinese envoy to protest China’s reported recent aggression and reclamation activities in the West Philippine Sea.
This time, however, the senator wants President Benigno Aquino III to tell the Chinese envoy that “we don’t want any fight with China but we are standing firm on our territorial claim in the West Philippine Sea.”
“It’s important for the Philippines and China to talk, that’s the first step,” Marcos said, as he urged Malacañang to intensify efforts at exploring all diplomatic avenues to find a peaceful means in resolving the conflicts with China. IDL
