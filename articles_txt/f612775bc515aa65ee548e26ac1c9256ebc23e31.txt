ST. LOUIS (KPLR) – The Missouri Narcotics Officers Association is backing a bill aimed at taking the profitability out of drug-dealing.  State Rep. Shawn Rhoads, (R) West Plains, has introduced House Bill 1138 .  It would tax drug dealers.  The bill passed out of committee last week.
Under the proposal, drug dealers would be required to purchases stamps from the Department of Revenue.  The stamps would be required on any illegal drugs being sold.  When drug dealers are busted, if their drugs don’t have a stamp, a fine would be levied.  Money from the sale of and illegal absence of stamps would be used for drug fighting purposes.
The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse in the St. Louis area does not have an official position on the bill but calls the idea, “intriguing.”
“It’s a way to fund treatment prevention which is sorely underfunded in the state and in the nation,” said NCADA’s Jared Opsel.   “It’s also a way to fund law enforcement activities going after traffickers of illegal substances.”
Opsel is aware of 17 states with similar taxes on illegal drug sales.
“Kansas is seeing about $4 million a year. North Carolina is seeing about $9 to $10 million dollars a year,” he said.
The public awareness specialist admits some people may dismiss the idea because it sounds unusual.
“It’s not exactly a novel idea anymore,” said Opsel.  “There’s quite a bit of data out there to show the best way to set up these programs, and show how they can be effective.”
