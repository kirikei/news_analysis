Former Los Angeles policeman, sought in murder, arrested in Mexico
MEXICO CITY
MEXICO CITY A former Los Angeles police officer, who fled after he was accused of killing a man following a fight near a southern California nightclub district, has been arrested in northern Mexico, state prosecutors said on Tuesday.
Henry Solis, 27, was detained in the border city of Ciudad Juarez and was handed over to Mexican migration authorities, the Chihuahua state prosecutor's office said in a statement.
Agents of the state prosecutor's office captured Solis on Tuesday following coordination with U.S. authorities, it added.
Solis is accused of shooting Salome Rodriguez Jr. multiple times on March 13 near a strip of nightclubs in downtown Pomona, about 35 miles (55 km) east of Los Angeles.
Solis, who was off-duty at the time of the shooting, was terminated by the Los Angeles Police Department after he was named a suspect in the case.
Authorities said Solis then fled to Mexico, allegedly with the help of his father, 53-year-old Victor Solis. The father was arrested in late March and was charged with lying to federal agents.
