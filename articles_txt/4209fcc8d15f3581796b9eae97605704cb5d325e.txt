An airman at Grand Forks Air Force Base has been identified as the gunman in a shooting early Tuesday at a local Walmart that left one employee dead and another injured before he turned the gun on himself. Police say the airman, Marcell Willis, 21, walked into the store shortly after 1 a.m. Tuesday and shot two employees with a handgun. They said he tried to shoot another worker but missed, then killed himself. The police said the shooting appeared to have been random. They had not found a link between Airman Willis and the Walmart store or the employees. The authorities did not immediately identify the two workers who had been shot.
