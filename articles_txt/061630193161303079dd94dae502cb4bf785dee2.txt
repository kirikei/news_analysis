For nearly 15 years, undocumented students at Texas public colleges have paid in-state tuition costs if they met certain criteria, including graduating from a Texas high school. State lawmakers Monday will take a first look at effectively repealing the 2001 law, which made Texas the first of at least 18 states that now have comparable laws.
Under Sen. Donna Campbell's SB 1819 , colleges would allowed to charge undocumented students only out-of-state tuition, which can sometimes double the cost of a college degree.
Supporters and opponents of the measure will settle in for a long day of likely emotional, heated testimony. The national immigration discussion will hang over the hearing, with both sides taking their cases to lawmakers after years of a public back-and-forth.
Campbell's supporters say the state needs to focus on giving college privileges to American citizens only, while a vocal group of immigrant students and their allies have trashed the bill as anti-immigrant measure that will encourage students to drop-out.
