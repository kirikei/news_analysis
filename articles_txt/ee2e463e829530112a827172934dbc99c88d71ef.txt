Singapore Airlines said on Wednesday it was investigating how one of its jets suffered a loss of power in both of its engines over the weekend, falling 3,962m (13,000ft) before regaining altitude en route from Singapore to Shanghai.
The Airbus A330-300 was carrying 182 passengers and 12 crew members when the incident occurred on Saturday, the airline said. The jet lost power in both engines after hitting bad weather three-and-a-half hours into the flight. Power was restored after “the pilots followed operational procedures to restore normal operation of the engines”, the airline said.
Data from FlightRadar24.com and a report in the Aviation Herald revealed the plane was cruising at 11,887m (39,000ft), about 260km (162 miles) from Hong Kong, when both Rolls-Royce Trent 772 engines stopped working.
The jet dropped to 7,925m (26,000ft) before power was restored, and climbed back to 9,510m (31,200ft) before landing safely in Shanghai about an hour and 40 minutes later, the report said.
Singapore Airlines said no “anomalies” were detected in either of the engines. The plane later took off to return to Singapore after a two-hour delay, Aviation Herald reported.
