Greenback rallies to 8-year high against yen
Published: 10:04 am, Wednesday, 27 May 2015
The US dollar pressed to an eight-year high against the yen on more signs that the US economy is emerging  from its winter chill.
Modest improvements in US consumer confidence, home sales and  prices, and orders for core industrial goods pointed to growth  gathering strength in the United States.
The US dollar pushed as high as 123.22 yen, and hit a one-month  high of against the euro.
The euro also suffered under rising worries that cash-starved  Greece might not reach a deal with official creditors to avoid  possible default on hits massive debts.
'Market reaction on Tuesday is more consistent with a belief  Greece maybe on the cusp of default,' said Jasper Lawler, a market  analyst with CMC Markets UK.
Also underpinning the greenback was Federal Reserve Chair Janet  Yellen's speech on Friday in which she stressed that interest rates  should begin rising this year and that delaying the long-awaited  move risks the economy overheating.
The same view was reiterated by Yellen's deputy Stanley Fischer  on Tuesday.
'Dollar bulls are back in the saddle again on the first full  trading day of this holiday-shortened week as speeches from  important Federal Reserve members has sparked a bit of US dollar  love,' said Neal Gilbert of Forex.com.
'The old saying about 'Don't Fight the Fed' is being respected.'
