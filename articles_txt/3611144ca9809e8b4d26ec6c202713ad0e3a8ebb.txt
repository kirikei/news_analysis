Lolita Grayson and her lawyers declined to comment after the announcement.
Mark NeJame, Alan Grayson's attorney, would not detail the settlement terms furthe but said he wants to present a final agreement to LeBlanc by the end of the day.
NeJame did not elaborate on whether the bigamy claims are acknowledged in the settlement. He just said that a "legal marriage" will be annulled.
The Graysons had contemplated a settlement before LeBlanc urged them to at their last hearing. It would spare everyone, including the couple's five children, embarrassment, LeBlanc said.
LeBlanc suggested the option during a March 23 hearing after awarding Lolita Grayson $20,000 — paid for by her congressman husband — so her attorneys can prepare for today's resumption of a hearing on the bigamy allegations.
Lolita Grayson, 55, filed for divorce from her husband on Jan. 6, 2014 — two months before unsubstantiated allegations that Alan Grayson, a 57-year-old Democrat, had physically abused her.
He responded with his own petition for annulment, arguing that his marriage was void because Lolita Grayson had not divorced her first husband when the couple got married in Virginia in 1990.
The validity of their marriage has implications on the division of the couple's $30 million fortune.
