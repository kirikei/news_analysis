MADISON, Wisconsin — Wisconsin lawmakers have formerly introduced a bill that would legalize blaze pink for hunters.
Democratic state Rep. Nick Milroy and Republican Reps. Joel Kleefisch and David Steffen unveiled the bill during a news conference Tuesday. All three lawmakers wore fluorescent pink T-shirts emblazoned with the message "Hunt Pink."
They said the bill is designed to attract more women to hunting and hope it will encourage apparel manufacturers to partner with nonprofit groups working to get more people, men and women, interested in hunting.
University of Wisconsin-Madison textiles expert Majid Sarmadi told reporters that blaze pink is just as visible in the woods as traditional blaze orange.
Milroy, Kleefisch and Steffan said they plan to spend the next two weeks soliciting co-sponsors for the measure.
