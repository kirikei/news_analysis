Singapore Airlines Investigates Engine Problem During Flight
SINGAPORE Â— May 27, 2015, 2:20 AM ET
Singapore Airlines said Wednesday that it is investigating how one of its jets suffered a loss of power in both of its engines over the weekend, falling 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) before regaining altitude en route from Singapore to Shanghai.
The Airbus A330-300 was carrying 182 passengers and 12 crew members when the incident occurred Saturday, the airline said in a statement. The jet lost power in both engines after hitting bad weather 3 1/2 hours into the flight. Power was restored after "the pilots followed operational procedures to restore normal operation of the engines," the statement said.
Data from FlightRadar24.com and a report in the Aviation Herald revealed that the plane was cruising at 39,000 feet (11,887 meters), about 260 kilometers (162 miles) from Hong Kong , when both Rolls-Royce Trent 772 engines stopped working.
The jet dropped to 26,000 feet (7,925 meters) before power was restored, and climbed back to 31,200 feet (9,510 meters) before it landed safely in Shanghai about 1 hour, 40 minutes later, the report said.
Singapore Airlines said that no "anomalies" were detected in either of the engines, and that it is reviewing the incident with Rolls-Royce and Airbus.
The plane later took off to return to Singapore after a two-hour delay, Aviation Herald reported.
