At least nine people, including three women and two children, have been killed and a number of others wounded in new Saudi airstrikes against different areas in Yemen, including schools and medical centers.
The fatalities occurred on Tuesday as Saudi jets targeted Jabal Sabir district in the southern province of Ta’izz.
Saudi Arabia also attacked a Yemeni training base in the city of Hudaydah in western Yemen and the Aden International Airport.
Saudi Arabia also carried out six attacks on a medical center and a school in Hayran city in Hajjah Province in eastern Yemen, leaving at least five people wounded. The Saudi airstrikes also targeted an area near a governmental complex in Hajjah seven times.
Riyadh launched its military aggression against Yemen on March 26 without a United Nations mandate.
The Saudi war aims to weaken the Houthi Ansarullah movement, which currently controls the capital, Sana’a, and major provinces, and to restore power to Yemen’s President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh.
A recent report by Oxfam aid agency said that nearly two-thirds of the population of war-hit Yemen, or 16 million people, had no access to clean water. Aid agencies have also warned of an outbreak of diseases, including malaria and cholera, among Yemenis, who are now forced to drink unsafe water.
Since March, nearly 2,000 people have been killed and more than 7,300 injured due to the conflict in Yemen, the United Nations says.
