A Baton Rouge mother was arrested after an East Baton Rouge Sheriff's deputy found her three children alone in an apartment over the weekend, according to WAFB .
Jasmine Moore, 24, was booked with three counts of cruelty to a juvenile, three counts of child desertion, and three counts of criminal abandonment.
A deputy received an anonymous complaint that three kids were left in an apartment on Jade Avenue for about an hour. Once inside, the deputy reported that he saw a small 1-year-old child naked, urinating, and crying. A 5-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl were also found in the home.
