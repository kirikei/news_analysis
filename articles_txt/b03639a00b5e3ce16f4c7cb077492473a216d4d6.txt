Gov. Larry Hogan issued has an executive order to extend the legislative session.
The governor's office released a statement Monday, saying the session would be extended for no longer than 10 days "to provide additional time for legislators to pass a budget."
"During the 10-day extension, the budget bill is the only piece of legislation that can be debated among the General Assembly," the statement read.
"With the final week of session upon us, I am happy to give legislators extra time to reach an agreement on the budget. I remain committed to working with the General Assembly to reach a bipartisan budget resolution that delivers the tax relief and fiscal responsibility that Marylanders are demanding," Hogan said in the statement.
The state constitution provides for the governor to take such action when the budget bill has not been passed by the 83rd day of the regular legislative session.
