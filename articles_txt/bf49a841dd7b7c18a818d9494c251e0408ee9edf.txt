Civil rights leaders at the National Action Network's 17th Annual Convention are urging the Senate to confirm Loretta Lynch as the country's next attorney general. 
President Barack Obama nominated Lynch to fill the position about 150 days ago. 
She's waited longer than any other attorney general nominee for a confirmation.
Reverand Al Sharpton says the delay is worrisome.
"Times are too serious, things are too on-edge for us not to have a sitting, confirmed attorney general to decide where we are," Sharpton said.
Lynch still serves as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. 
Sharpton says the Senate was quick to confirm her for that office in 2010—and this time should be no different. 
He adds the National Action Network, the NAACP and other civil rights groups will petition Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell everyday until a vote is called.
