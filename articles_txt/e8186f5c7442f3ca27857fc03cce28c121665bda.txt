LAS CRUCES, N.M. – Gov. Susana Martinez signed two bills that address the state’s nursing shortage.
Both bills make it possible for nurses to receive financial aid to help earn an advanced degree, which is required if they want to become instructors.
The Department of Health says New Mexico’s nursing shortage is actually worse than the national average because one third of nurses are above the retirement age.
Martinez said this should lead to more nurse educators and more nurses seeking graduate degrees.
"This piece of legislation is so important, because it allows for the instructors, the teachers to teach nurses, because they're going back to school. They can pay those student loans and then they become the educator of younger nurses,” Martinez said.
If HB 121 sounds familiar, that's because it was sponsored by local state Rep. Dr. Terry McMillan, who is the only physician in the Legislature.
