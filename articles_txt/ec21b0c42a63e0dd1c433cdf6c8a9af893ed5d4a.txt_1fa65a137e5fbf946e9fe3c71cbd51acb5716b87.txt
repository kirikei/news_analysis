Queen Elizabeth will set out the British government’s plans for a European Union membership referendum on Wednesday as prime minister David Cameron faces pressure to explain when it will be held and what changes to the EU he wants before then.
Mr Cameron, who says he would prefer to stay inside a reformed EU but isn’t “ruling anything out” if it fails to change, was re-elected on May 7th on a pledge to reshape ties with the bloc before allowing Britons to vote on whether to stay or leave.
The queen (89) will detail the plans in a speech written for her by Cameron’s government as she opens parliament with an annual display of pomp.
Among other measures expected to feature was a reform of human rights laws designed to weaken the influence of the European Court of Human Rights, but several newspapers reported hours before the speech that the bill had now been delayed.
The Conservatives are divided over the plan, and the newspapers said the prime minister had backed away from an early fight within his own camp.
On the EU, the queen will say the new government plans to pass a law in its first year that would allow the referendum to occur by the end of 2017.
In a gesture meant to underscore Mr Cameron’s seriousness, the law will be introduced into parliament just a day later, on Thursday, as he embarks on a European tour to try to charm sometimes reluctant counterparts into backing EU reform. It will include talks with French president Francois Hollande in Paris and German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.
Mr Cameron has said he would be ready to hold the referendum before 2017 if he completes the renegotiation early, something some pro-EU campaigners advocate. But he is under pressure from some Eurosceptic lawmakers who want him to ask for more and to take his time.
“I think we need a proper grown-up debate - it’s the most important constitutional issue of my lifetime. It’s something that we should properly take our time over,” Liam Fox, a senior Conservative and a former defence secretary, told BBC radio.
Some EU politicians have complained they don’t know enough, beyond what they say are broad and nebulous goals, about what it is Cameron wants to change. He says he wants to decouple Britain from the EU’s aim of “ever closer union” and to be able to restrict EU migrants’ access to Britain’s welfare system.
Mr Cameron is adamant that such changes would require re-opening the EU’s founding treaties, something countries such as France are opposed to.
Other laws the queen will outline on Wednesday include a crackdown on illegal immigration, more powers for Scotland , and a bill preventing any rise in key taxes before 2020.

The Queen's Speech will not include scrapping European human rights laws(BBC)
Prime Minister David Cameron appears to have reversed his position on scrapping European human rights laws – at least in the first year of his government.
Although he and other senior Tories have been touting a British Bill of Rights to replace European human rights laws – it was a key plank in the Conservative election manifesto – it will not be in the Queen's Speech presented on 27 May.
Other senior Conservatives, include Dominic Grieve, the former attorney-general, David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, and Andrew Mitchell, the former chief whip are opposed to the new Bill, reported The Times .
It also reported that some serving ministers have threatened to resign if the Bill is introduced – and with a majority of only 12, Cameron's wriggle room is limited.
It would be 'odd if we didn't consult widely'
Despite detailed legislation drawn up by Conservative lawyers during the last parliament, a government source told The Times it was now more important to get the Bill "right, rather than quickly", adding it would be "odd if we did not consult widely".
Justice Secretary – and Lord Chancellor – Michael Gove is in charge of scrapping the 1998 Human Rights Act and limiting the force on British courts of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Senior government figures urged Gove not to rush the reform. "I would urge him not to go for it in the first three months," one member of the cabinet was quoted as saying. "Departments have to deal with spending cuts in that period too."
Sir Brian Leveson – who headed the Leveson Inquiry into the British media – supported the European convention, telling an audience at the Hay Festival that it had been brought in as part of Europe's recovery from the Second World War. "I do not consider myself 'crushed by the European jackboot'," he said.
Amnesty International has paid for double-page adverts in the national press, signed by more than 1,000 people who back the "Save the Act" campaign.
It said: "The Human Rights Act protects us all, especially society's most vulnerable. It protects women fleeing from domestic violence. It makes it safer to be gay. For those of us who are disabled, it ensures we can get the support we need to live a dignified life."
Elsewhere in the Queen's Speech, the government will present plans to further Scottish devolution. It will also present plans to give English MPs more say over measures that only affect England.
It will introduce new counter-extremism bill aimed at tackling radicalisation, as well as proposing legislation to ban so-called legal highs.
Cameron said the speech would set out a "clear vision for what our country can be".
The prime minister added this would mean that "wherever you live you can have the chance of a good education, a decent job, a home of your own and the peace of mind that comes from being able to raise a family and enjoy a secure retirement".
Labour said the reality would be "very different from the rhetoric", while the Liberal Democrats will accuse the Tories of abandoning liberalism.
Harriet Harman, Labour's acting leader, said the Conservatives wanted to "set the nations of the country against each other" and threaten "basic rights at work".
