The rights of California's undocumented immigrants would be drastically expanded, if a proposed packet of legislation is passed.
The rights of California's undocumented immigrants would be drastically expanded, if a proposed packet of legislation is passed.
Democratic lawmakers are pushing ten bills called "Immigrants Shape California." One of the bills would open up Medi-Cal services to all undocumented immigrants with an eligible income.
Others would protect immigrants from workplace discrimination.
"Immigrants, documented and undocumented, are woven into every part of California's social fabric, and make a huge contribution to our economic strength,"  Asm. Toni Atkins said.
Those who are opposed to the bills say they will come with a big price tag, with no clear way on how the state will pay for them.
