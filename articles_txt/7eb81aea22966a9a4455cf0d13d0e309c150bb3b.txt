Following news of Tuesday's announcement, TiVo's stock shares rose 6.2 percent. TiVo officials also revealed plans for an acquisition of Cubiware, a Poland-based digital television software company. 
"We will continue to look at acquisitions that we think make strategic sense," TiVo Chief Executive Tom Rogers said in an interview with Reuters . 
Rogers also added that the company is looking at "a lot of things."
Although Cubiware is based in Poland, the company conducts business all across the world. In fact, TiVo's acquisition is expected to help the digital video recorder company expand into 25 new countries.
