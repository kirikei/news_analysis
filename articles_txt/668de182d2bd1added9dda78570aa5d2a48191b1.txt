Mitt Romney’s tournament bracket was almost perfect
04.07.15 at 1:10 pm ET
CNN – Mitt Romney on Monday night found himself once again in the exclusive club of the 0.1%.
This time, though, Romney’s elite status has nothing to do with his multi-million dollar fortune, and everything to do with the results of the NCAA tournament.
Romney’s bracket ranked 6,326th out of the more than 11.5 million brackets filled out on ESPN.com, meaning he scored better than 99.9% of all entrants. …
Romney’s top ranking came after Duke University took home the trophy over the University of Wisconsin in the NCAA final Monday night.
Romney correctly picked the Final Four teams and six of the Elite Eight.
And in an apparent nod to his $10,000 wager to Gov. Rick Perry during a 2012 Republican presidential debate, Romney joked on Twitter Monday that he “should have put $10,000 on my bracket.”
Taking politics completely out of the equation, I just realized what I hate about Mitt Romney — I am not him.
Romney is in that class of men I can’t stand above all others, he’s an achiever. He’s good looking. In fact, for his age he’s ridiculously handsome. He’s got business acumen I can only dream about and he’s made billions with it. He runs several companies and has responsibilities I can barely fathom. He’s got integrity enough to have been the guy they brought in to save the Salt Lake City Olympics from corruption and scandal. He’s got the kind of family you only see in Kirk Cameron movies or those books where a little kid visits heaven and then comes back. He does more for the clothes he wears than a store mannequin.
I have none of these things. I make a living that allows me to basically sleep 12 hours a day and think about sports the other 12. And yet Mitt Romney shames me and every man in America with his brackets. I was literally the first person in the country knocked out of the tournament when Iowa St. went down in the second game to finish on that first Thursday afternoon, and this absurdly successful guy who’s responsible to thousands of people was still able to curb stomp me using about .01 percent of his brain power.
This reminds me of the time my father-in-law invited this nationally known chef to golf with him. It was only like the third time the guy had golfed in the last calendar year because he was so incredibly busy growing his culinary empire, and he not only shot about 10 strokes better than I ever had at that same course, he had a hole-in-one. I never met the man, but I’ll despise him forever.
I can forgive a lot of things. I can admire someone who’s successful. But when you’re a super overachiever in your own field then do much, much better than me at the things that have a disproportionate importance in my life, I will despise you forever. You’ve made a very powerful enemy, Mitt Romney.
Which is to say not powerful at all, really. At life or gambling.
