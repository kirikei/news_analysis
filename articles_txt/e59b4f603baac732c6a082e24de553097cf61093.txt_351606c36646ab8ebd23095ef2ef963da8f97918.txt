A member of Al Qaeda who led a firefight in Afghanistan in 2008 that killed an Army Ranger pleaded guilty on Tuesday in Brooklyn to four counts related to his terrorism activities.
Saddiq Al-Abbadi, 40, also helped get a Long Island man, Bryant Neal Vinas, into Al Qaeda , prosecutors said in court documents; Mr. Vinas, who later planned a bomb attack on the Long Island Rail Road that was not carried out, eventually became a cooperating witness for the government .
Mr. Al-Abbadi, a Yemeni man, faces a minimum of 30 years in prison, and a maximum of life, when he is sentenced in September. He delivered the guilty plea in Federal District Court in Brooklyn about four months after he was extradited to the United States from Saudi Arabia, where he had served five years of a 12-year sentence in a terrorism case.
Instead, they suggested, a military detention and interrogation would be more appropriate.
Mr. Al-Abbadi told the court on Tuesday that he “fought in Iraq between 2005 and 2009 against the United States of America with the intention to hurt, wound or kill these forces.” He also admitted to being a member of Al Qaeda and said he knew that the United States considered it a terrorist organization.
He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder American nationals abroad, to providing material support to a terrorist group, to conspiracy to provide that support and to unlawful use of firearms.
Mr. Al-Abbadi led attacks against American troops in Paktia Province, Afghanistan, in May and June 2008, prosecutors wrote in court papers. In the May battle, two Army Rangers were wounded and one was killed.
Two weeks later, he plotted another attack, planning on luring soldiers to a compound in Ghazni Province that was designed to blow up when they entered. However, an American soldier spotted suspicious wiring, and the soldiers backed off.
Mr. Al-Abbadi went from his home in Yemen to Iraq in 2003, according to a complaint filed by prosecutors. By 2008, he was fighting against American soldiers in Ghazni. Someone who later became a cooperating witness for the government — the witness is not named in the complaint — met Mr. Al-Abbadi and his co-defendant, Ali Alvi, at a Qaeda safe house in Pakistan. They both carried Kalashnikov rifles.
Mr. Al-Abbadi showed the witness a scar from a bullet wound that he got from fighting the United States military and Blackwater contractors in Iraq, and a video of him celebrating after a jihadist attack in Iraq.
In August 2008, the witness saw Mr. Al-Abbadi again at a mosque. Mr. Al-Abbadi said that he had fought in Ghazni, and that the fighting was good. Mr. Al-Abbadi was there to meet with Sheikh Saeed al-Masri, then the third-ranking member of Al Qaeda.
He also has strong ties to Al Qaeda’s Yemen branch, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, prosecutors wrote. Indeed, when the witness was having a hard time getting accepted into Al Qaeda in Pakistan, Mr. Al-Abbadi assured the witness he could get him into Al Qaeda in Yemen.

Saddiq al-Abbadi, who was arrested with an alleged co-conspirator in Saudi Arabia, faces a maximum life sentence in a US prison at his sentencing.
"The defendant was a high-level al-Qaeda operative with ties to the terrorist group's senior leadership in both Pakistan and Yemen," said Acting US Attorney Kelly Currie.
"He fought in battles against US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to kill US troops in Afghanistan by luring them to a compound rigged with explosives, and helped an American citizen gain entry to al-Qaeda," he said yesterday.
According to court papers, Abbadi traveled from his home country Yemen to Iraq where, from approximately late 2005 through early 2007, he fought alongside al-Qaeda affiliated battalions against US troops stationed in Iraq.
In early 2008, Abbadi traveled to Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) to fight for al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, prosecutors said.
While in FATA, Abbadi -- who had longstanding ties to senior members of al-Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) -- engaged directly with the senior al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan, including Sheikh Saeed al-Masri, the then-third ranking member, it said.
During late spring and summer of 2008, Abbadi crossed from Pakistan into Afghanistan for the purpose of fighting and killing members of the US military stationed in Afghanistan.
In June 2008, he planned an operation designed to lure US forces to a compound in Ghazni, Afghanistan, that was rigged with explosives set to detonate upon their entry.
When US forces arrived at the compound, they found rocket- propelled grenades and artillery rounds littered around.
One soldier observed wires running from the exterior gate to the inside of the compound and recognised the trap. The military evacuated and subsequently leveled the compound.
"With today's guilty plea, Al-Abbadi admitted to directly supporting the mission of a designated terrorist organization through planning an operation designed to kill US forces and for engaging in recruitment efforts on behalf of al-Qaeda," said Assistant Director in Charge Andrew G McCabe of the FBI's Washington, DC , Field Office.
In addition to fighting against the US military, Abbadi used his connections with al-Qaeda's leadership to help US citizen Bryant Neal Vinas gain entry into al-Qaeda.
Vinas had traveled to Pakistan from Long Island, New York, hoping to joine al-Qaeda and fight against the US forces in Afghanistan.
As a result of Abbadi's assistance, Vinas was allowed to join al-Qaeda.
