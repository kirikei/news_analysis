Legislation to prohibit Texas elected officials from “double dipping” – collecting a state pension while still in office earning a salary – won unanimous approval from the Senate on Tuesday.
The bill was prompted by former Gov. Rick Perry’s revelation a few years ago that that he was collecting a state pension of about $90,000 in addition to his $150,000 salary as governor. The double dipping was disclosed in a personal financial statement Perry filed as a presidential candidate.
Under the measure, sponsored by Sen. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio, and Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, all elected officials in the state Employees Retirement System except for district attorneys could not receive pension payments while still holding office. The bill is not retroactive and would only apply to those elected once the bill is signed into law.
“Clearly, it’s a bad practice that erodes the public trust, and it’s something I’m glad we have bipartisan support to end,” Turner said. The bill passed the Senate on a 31-0 vote and the House on a 137-2 vote.
The measure must return to the House for concurrence in an amendment approved by the Senate that would deny a pension to any officeholder convicted of a felony related to his duties as a public official. That amendment was sponsored by Sen. Van Taylor, R-Plano.
