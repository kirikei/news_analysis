Organizers say the national gay-rights group PFLAG and others will gather Saturday afternoon in downtown Indianapolis before traveling to Lucas Oil stadium, where the college basketball games are being played.
The event follows widespread criticism over a new Indiana law that critics said could allow discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents. Supporters said the law would protect religious liberties, but the national fallout prompted lawmakers to revise the law Thursday to specify it couldn't be used to discriminate.
Protesters say more is needed because Indiana's civil-rights law doesn't include specific protections for the LGBT community.
