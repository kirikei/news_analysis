Eugenie Bouchard may have hit her on-court peak for this season in January at the Australian Open, where she reached the quarter-finals and lost to eventual finalist Maria Sharapova.
Her off-court highlight may have come a week ago when Sports Pro magazine named her the most marketable athlete on the planet for 2015. But the first line of her bio read, “Poster girl heading for the top of women’s sport, if she can regain her balance.”
That balance seems to be teeter-tottering. The native of Montreal changed management companies, joining WME ¦ IMG at the end of last year. She also has a new coach, as Genie is guided by Victoria Azarenka’s ex-coach Sam Sumyk. Nick Saviano had been Bouchard’s coach since she was 12.
Today, Eugenie lost her opening match of the French Open in straight sets to Kristina Mladenovic of France. Since the Oz tourney, she has not won more than two matches in a row.
Last year, she reached the semis of the first three majors and went one step further at Wimbledon, where she was defeated in the final to Petra Kvitova.
With her new found fame from 2014, Bouchard has been in demand, especially off of the court in 2015.
She rose to number six on the planet and that ranking will fall.
One of the first things I thought of today when I saw her lose, was, is she turning into Anna Kournikova?
You may remember the Russian player, who went from being a famous tennis player, to just being kind of famous.
Bouchard is only 21-years-old and maybe this is just a slump. Genie’s Army is hoping it is not a trend.
Kournikova never won a WTA singles title, at least Eugenie has one.
