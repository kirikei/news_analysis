Kansas coach Bill Self is one of three winners of the 2015 Mannie Jackson Human Spirit Award, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame announced on Tuesday.
Self will be recognized in September alongside former NBA star Steve Smith and former Reebok CEO Paul Fireman. All three will be honored on Sept. 10 at the Reunion Dinner during Enshrinement weekend at the Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.
“It is an honor for us to recognize these three outstanding men for their humanitarian efforts,” said John L. Doleva, president and CEO of the Basketball Hall of Fame. “The Mannie Jackson — Basketball’s Human Spirit Award is a prestigious honor awarded only to those with this highest level of dedication to making the world a better place (and) each of these recipients is tremendously worthy.”
According to a release from the Naismith Hall of Fame, Self was selected, in part, for his work with his Assists Foundation, an organization established by he and his wife, Cindy, to help fund programs such as the Kansas Action for Healthy Kids, Lawrence Public Library, Boys and Girls Clubs of Lawrence, Kansas Youth Empowerment Academy, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Northeast Kansas and Head Start of Lawrence, among others.
Self, who has guided Kansas to 11 straight Big 12 titles and one NCAA championship in 12 seasons, is entering his 13th season at KU. The Mannie Jackson Award is named for the former Harlem Globetrotter who has since served as the chairman and owner of the Globetrotters.
