AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Auburn University officials say a information safety lapse left individual info belonging to roughly 370,000 existing, former and prospective students accessible on-line for months.
Officials said in a statement Friday that facts like names, birthdates, social security numbers and academic info was exposed on the internet between September 2014 and March 2. Officials say the safety lapse did not involve any financial details.
Officials say the breach stemmed from the configuration of a device that had been installed to replace a server. Officials say the server has been secured and there is no proof of misuse of the private details.
Officials say people today whose data was accessible have been notified by mail and supplied two absolutely free years of credit monitoring and identity protection. The university is now reviewing its data storage policies.
