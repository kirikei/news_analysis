This isn’t your parents’ Point Break. The first trailer for Warner Bros.’ remake of the 1991 Keanu Reeves/Patrick Swayze classic looks 100 percent serious with wilder extreme sports for the gang and far fewer rubber president masks than Kathryn Bigelow’s original feature . In this glimpse, there’s rock climbing, wingsuiting, and casual motorbiking…away from a rock slide.
The basic plot details sound familiar enough: Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) is a young FBI agent tasked with infiltrating a group of thrill seekers, led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez), whom the feds suspect are pulling off crazy crimes. “Crazy” like taking a Walter White-like block of money from a plane, only to break the bands and make it rain on a third-world village. Don’t worry: It appears the visors on the crew’s helmets have presidential visages. 
Point Break is directed by Ericson Core, based off Kurt Wimmer’s script, and is scheduled for a limited release on Dec. 25, 2015, before a wide release.
