BOISE (AP) | Idaho lawmakers have approved a new state office intended to coordinate efforts by schools and industry to promote science, technology, engineering and math.
The STEM Action Center is getting two full-time staffers and nearly $540,000 to launch.
Coeur d'Alene Sen. Bob Nonini, one of the sponsors of the legislation, told The Spokesman-Review newspaper that he was extremely pleased now that the legislation has won the support of both houses and had funding allocated by the budget-setting committee.
The STEM Action Center will operate as a state office under Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter, with the goal of identifying and coordinating best practices for STEM education in state schools. The center will also coordinate professional development efforts for teachers, work with industry officials on workforce needs and opportunities and coordinate STEM-related competitions, camps and more.
The bill now awaits the governor's signature.
