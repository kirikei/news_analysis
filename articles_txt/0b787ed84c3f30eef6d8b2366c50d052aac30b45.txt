JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - State building repairs, technology startups, local libraries and university programs are among the programs that will share $43 million in funding released by Missouriâ€™s governor.
Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon said Friday that he plans to release $43 million of funds immediately after the state took in higher general revenues in March.
General revenues increased from March 2014 by 25 percent, bringing the year-to-date increase to 6.8 percent.
Budget director Linda Luebbering says part of the difference is due to a lawsuit settlement and other one-time changes but mainly it was a good month for economic growth.
The money includes $7 million for the Missouri Technology Corporation, a public-private partnership to promote technology start-ups.
And about $5.8 million will go to public libraries across the state.
