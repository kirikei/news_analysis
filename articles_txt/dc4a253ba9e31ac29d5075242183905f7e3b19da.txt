Summary
Sunday afternoon session of the 185th Annual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
General Authorities from a variety of nationalities gave sermons, some of them in languages other than English, at the closing session of the LDS Church's 185th Annual General Conference on Sunday afternoon.
President Thomas S. Monson presided, as he had done throughout the conference. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, second counselor in the First Presidency, conducted the session, with Elders S. Gifford Nielen and Koichi Aoyagi of the Seventy giving the invocation and benediction, respectively.
Speakers at the session included Elders Russell M. Nelson, Robert D. Hales and Neil L. Anderson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and Elders Kevin W. Pearson, Rafael E. Pino, Jorge F. Zeballos and Joseph W. Sitati of the Seventy.
Topics included religious freedom, enduring to the end, the eternal perspective of the gospel, the spreading forth of the Kingdom of God, fulfilling divinely given responsibilities, multiplying and subduing the earth, and Sabbath observance.
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, directed by Mack Wilberg and Ryan Murphy with Linda Margetts and Bonnie Goodliffe as organists, provided music for the session.
On this Easter Sunday, the musical selections pertained directly to the Lord Jesus Christ: “My Redeemer Lives,” “He Sent His Son,” “Tell Me the Stories of Jesus” and “Lord, I Would Follow Thee.” The congregation sang “Come, O Thou King of Kings.”
