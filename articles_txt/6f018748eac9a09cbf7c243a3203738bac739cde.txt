Keira Knightley is believed to have given birth to a baby girl, her first child with her husband James Righton.
Multiple sources are said to have confirmed to E! News that the 30 year old actress and her 31 year old husband, formerly a member of nu-rave band Klaxons, welcomed their daughter into the world in London on Tuesday (May 26th).
Knightley and Righton got married in the south of France in May 2013, having been dating since early 2011. They announced that they were expecting a baby in December last year.

Her friend Sienna Miller said in an interview back in January that she reckons that Knightley will be a “perfect” mother. “We’ve spoken a lot and I know she will be amazing,” Miller said. “She doesn’t need any advice!”

She also told Ellen about how she’s been using her pregnancy as an excuse to get her husband to attend awards ceremonies. “I'm [telling him], ‘You have to come with me, support me!’ There's a lot of free champagne [at events], so he thinks because I'm not drinking, he has two. I'm eating for two and he's drinking for two.”
Finally, she admitted that though she was excited to be a mother, she was also looking forward to being able to drink alcohol again following the birth. “When can I drink? Please?” she joked, “I just want a margarita!”
