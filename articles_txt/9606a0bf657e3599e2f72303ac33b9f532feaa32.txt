Christie calls meeting of N.J. Republican county chairs | The Auditor
The governor has called the state's 21 Republican county chairs in for a early Thursday morning for a breakfast meeting at Drumthwacket, the official governor's residence, The Auditor is told.
This is not the first time the governor has called such a meeting at Drumthwacket, which Christie does not actually live in. It happens about once a year.
The Auditor couldn't help but wonder about it in the context of the 2012 presidential race when Christie, after declining to run for president himself, told county chairs to hold off on backing candidates until he made a decision on whom he would support.
Christie has said he'll make a decision on running for president by late spring or early summer.
The county chairs have not been informed what the meeting is about.
