MADISON, Wis. (WFRV) - Joshua Van Haften, 34, appeared in federal court Thursday morning on charges of attempting to support a terrorist organization.
According to the U.S. Justice Department, Van Haften was arrested Wednesday night at O'Hare Airport in Chicago after returning from Turkey. Officials said he has been the subject of a federal investigation since last summer and has been in custody in Turkey since October.
A criminal complaint claims Van Haften traveled to both Egypt and Turkey and in August, he intended to cross into Syria to contact ISIS.
"The case is really four components," explained John Vaudreuil, U.S. Attorney. "things he's said to his friends, things he's said on social media, his actual travel to turkey because he was in Turkey and his postings on social media indicating he's made at least one attempt to cross into Syria and got to the border but did not get into Syria."
Van Haften is also a convicted sex offender.
The U.S. attorney plans to take the case to a grand jury later this month. Van Haften faces up to 15 years in prison.
