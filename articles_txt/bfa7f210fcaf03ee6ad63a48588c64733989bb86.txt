OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee is rescinding a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana after a law that critics said had the potential to discriminate against gays and lesbians based on religious beliefs was amended.
The revised Indiana law bars discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or U.S. military service.
On Friday Inslee said Indiana's changed law "is a promising step toward greater cultural inclusion and acceptance for LGBT communities."
