Retailer Best Buy is looking to tempt LG G4 customers into preordering the smartphone by offering a $100 Best Buy gift card with the order.
Smartphone fans will soon have a new flagship device to consider in the form of the LG G4. The handset will directly compete with Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Samsung's Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge and the HTC One M9 in the high-end smartphone arena.
The LG G4 offers two coveted features Android fans have enjoyed and boasted about through the years when compared with Apple's iPhone lineup — a removable battery and microSD expansion slot. Samsung didn't please fans when it announced the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge would be the first flagship Galaxy S smartphones to not include a user-removable battery or microSD expansion slot. While HTC offers the One M9 with an expansion slot, the handset's aluminum case is completely sealed like Samsung's latest smartphones.
LG is hoping to sway consumers into purchasing the only flagship smartphone that still includes both a removable battery and microSD expansion slot. The G4 ships with a large 3000 mAh removable battery, and its microSD expansion slot will allow users to expand the included 32 GB of internal storage via up to 2 TB microSD cards.
LG recently announced that it would offer early U.S. G4 customers a free 32 GB microSD card, extra 3000 mAh battery and battery charging cradle when they purchased the phone between May 22 and June 21. In an attempt to attract customers into purchasing an LG G4 through them, Best Buy has announced it will sweeten that deal even further by including a $100 Best Buy gift card when customers preorder the smartphone online.

Starting Wednesday morning (May 27) at 9 A.M. (EST)/ 6 A.M. (PST).T-Mobile’s  LG G4 will be available for early online pre orders.
Those who pre order will have their devices by June 3rd.
Pre orders can be placed with no money down and 24 monthly payments of $24.99 on an EIP (Equipment Installment Plan), which means you pay the full retail price of  $599.76.
While that sounds like a lot, many consider it a bargain based on previews of the highly-advanced smartphone-especially if you get it with T-Mobile’s exclusive leather-backed option.
In addition, T-Mobile is also offering an exclusive free memory upgrade promo for anyone who buys the LG G4  between May 27 (Wednesday)-June 21st.
The promotion gives customers a 128 GB Micro SD memory card for their G4; the offer must be redeemed by July 7th and can take up to 6 weeks to arrive.
LG is also running another promotion, where anyone who buys the phone before June 21st will receive a 32 GB memory card, extra removable battery, and battery charging cradle- all for free as well.
To redeem this promotion you can go to  http://www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/g4/battery .
