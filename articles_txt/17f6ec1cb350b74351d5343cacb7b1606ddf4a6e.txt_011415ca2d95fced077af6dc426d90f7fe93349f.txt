China's Yuan drops as dollar strengthens amidst Fed's possible rate hike
By Reuters | 27 May, 2015, 12.31PM IST
The central bank set its guidance rate at a one-month low and weaker for the fourth straight session, fixing the midpoint for the daily trading range at 6.1198 per dollar prior to market open, 0.04 percent weaker than Tuesday's fix.
The spot market opened at 6.2043 per dollar and traded at 6.2054 at midday, down 0.02 percent from Tuesday's close.
The offshore yuan was trading 0.04 percent weaker from the onshore spot at 6.2079 per dollar.
While there has been growing demand for dollars, a trader at a European bank in Shanghai expected the yuan to keep to its recent narrow trading range of 6.18 to 6.20, where it has been since Chinese officials spoke in mid-March of keeping the currency stable.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday that the yuan is no longer undervalued, reversing a view it had held for many years.
Traders said the IMF comments echoed what Chinese officials believe that the yuan's value is now roughly balanced.
The remarks raised expectations that the yuan could be included in the basket of currencies used for the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) later this year.

BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhuanet) -- The International Monetary Fund says Tuesday the Chinese yuan is no longer undervalued, after the previous note of "modestly undervalued".
The agency said substantial real effective appreciation over the past years has lifted the exchange rate to a level that is no longer undervalued. But it also said the country's current account surplus and forex reserves are too strong and called for policy reforms.
The IMF also predicted that China's economy would grow 6.8 percent this year, slightly below the official target of seven percent. Its call on inflation was 1.5 percent. Analysts say the inclusion of Chinese yuan into the agency's Special Drawing Right is highly probable if not a done deal.
