Fiorina
CLINTON — A potential U.S. Presidential candidate will speak during the annual Clinton County Republican spring event.
Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, will be the guest speaker during the 40th annual event on April 23. A reception will start at 6 p.m. with buffet dinner to follow at 6:30 p.m. at the Clinton County Republican Agriculture Hall in DeWitt. 
Tickets are $40 and are available by calling Dan Smicker at (563) 343-3255 or Carolyn Tallett at 243-1193. Elected officials and central committee members also have tickets for sale. 
Arrangements for student tickets also may be made by calling Smicker or Tallett. 
Fiorina started out as a secretary for a small real-estate business, and later joined AT&T as an entry-level saleswoman. Fifteen years later, she led AT&T’s spin-out of Lucent Technologies and then Lucent’s North American operations. In 1999, she was recruited to Hewlett-Packard where she became the first woman to lead a Fortune-50 company. 
She was chairman and CEO of H-P for six years. She lost in her bid for a U.S. Senate seat from California in 2010 against Barbara Boxer.
