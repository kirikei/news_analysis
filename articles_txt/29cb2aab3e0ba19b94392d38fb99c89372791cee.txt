MATAWAN, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Chris Christie is taking his town hall series to Middlesex County.
The potential Republican presidential contender will hold what his office says is his 134th town hall event Tuesday at the Old Bridge High School gymnasium in Matawan.
It’s scheduled to begin at 3:30 p.m.
Christie has been holding the events every week as he tries to sell his proposal to further overhaul the state’s pension and health benefit system for public workers.
He sees his plan as a national model.
He’ll be taking his tour on the road for the first time next week when he holds two town hall events in the early-voting state of New Hampshire.
Last week’s event featured multiple protesters as well as a heated exchange between the governor and a public school teacher.
