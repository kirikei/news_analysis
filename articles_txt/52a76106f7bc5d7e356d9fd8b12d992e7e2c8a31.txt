LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — A former Los Angeles Police Department officer sought in connection with the shooting death of a man in Pomona reportedly has been arrested in Mexico.
Henry Solis had been on the run since the March 13 shooting of Salome Rodriguez Jr. Investigators believe the two men got into a fistfight outside of a bar in Pomona before 23-year-old Rodriguez was fatally shot.
Solis, who worked for the Los Angeles Police Department since June 2014, was linked to the crime from evidence left at the scene.
A search for him ensued after the 27-year-old former officer who was fired less than five days after the shooting did not show up for work after the incident.
Federal officials say his father, Victor Solis, drove him to El Paso, Texas, and dropped him off at a bus station.

Rodriguez’s mother Lydia says she posted on Facebook a few days ago asking for people to pray for Solis’ arrest: “We just did this chain of prayer and look. Those people who don’t believe in God, you don’t need to see God, God exists just by his doings. And you can feel Him.”
She says she has a lot of questions for Solis. She especially wants to know what happened the night her son was killed.
