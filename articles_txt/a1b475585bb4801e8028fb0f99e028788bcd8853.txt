Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports
The Cavaliers' star has improved to the point where he will suit up in Game 4 against the Hawks after missing the last two contests.
Cleveland Cavaliers All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving will return in Game 4 against the Atlanta Hawks after missing two contests with a knee injury, according to TNT's Rachel Nichols. Irving has been battling left knee and foot pain all postseason and it finally became too much after Game 1, but he will return to the court with the Cavaliers one win away from the NBA Finals .
Irving was listed as questionable before the game. The team's medical staff preferred he have "repeated good days" before letting him return to game action, which evidently has happened.
Irving earned Third Team All-NBA status after another superlative regular season, but has not been himself since midway through the Cavaliers' second-round series win over the Chicago Bulls . He played just 27 minutes in Game 1 of the series against the Hawks before sitting out. Backup Matthew Dellavedova has shined in his absence, nailing timely three-pointers and playing tough defense.
