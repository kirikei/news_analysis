Things go wrong while testing a self-parking car's assist feature in the Dominican Republic.
More details are emerging of the "human error" being blamed for a nasty failure of a car's safety feature demonstration.
The event in the Dominican Republic involved a Volvo XC60 and what was first stated to be its "self-parking assist feature".
Reports are now emerging that the demonstration was to show off the vehicle's "city-safe" systeam to recognise pedestrians and automatically stop the car.
Trouble was someone forgot to turn on the vehicle's "City Safe" mode and the car ploughed into two men standing in front of the vehicle.
The two men, according website Remolacha, escaped with bruising.
The incident is the not the first time a Volvo has been involved in a "whoops" moment. Back in 2010, an S60's automatic braking system failed at the demonstration event and ploughed into the back of a truck.
