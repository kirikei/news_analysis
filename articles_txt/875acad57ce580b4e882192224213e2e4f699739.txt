"Falling in love with a man never crossed my mind." 
Say what, Clint?!
It's a Bachelorette—and Bachelor—first: one of Kaitlyn's suitors has seemingly fallen in love with one of the other guys and we are kind of shocked. Don't believe us? Watch our exclusive promo above now!
Now, we're not shocked at a man falling in love with another man. It's 2015, sexuality is a spectrum, and when you throw a bunch of people in a house together, anything can happen. 
What shocked us about this confession from Clint was the object of his affection: JJ! 
Just last night, JJ was called a "turd" by Amy Schumer , and proved to all of the men in the house that he didn't care about kindness or fairness when it came to stealing time with Kaitlyn. He's just there to show her what "husband material" really looks like, and he's totally okay with being named this season's villain. 
In spite of all that, Clint looks like he has fallen hard. 
"Kaitlyn's not the right girl for me," he says in the exclusive promo above. "I love JJ, so I need the rose tonight." 
We had such high hopes for Clint too, after he presented Kaitlyn with this  glorious drawing of Chris Harrison riding a triceratops: 
We just feel like the architectural engineer could do so much better than a former investment banker who lacks "charisma and humility and a sense of humor," according to Amy Schumer (and also anyone who watched last night's show ). 
"We've gotten very close in the shower," Clint says, and we're not sure we want to know what he means by that, but we definitely, absolutely want to watch next week's episode (as if we weren't going to anyway). 
Is it just us or does this show have the best promos ?
The Bachelorette airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC.
