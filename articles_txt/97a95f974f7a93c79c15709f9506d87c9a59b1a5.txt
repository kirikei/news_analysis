The ministry for women and children said the ban was aimed at protecting homeless children living in tent camps where there are large numbers of people.
Ministry official Ram Prasad Bhattarai said an approval letter issued by a district child welfare board would be needed for any other adults travelling with children from one district to another. International adoptions had also been suspended, he said.
The ban comes days after police stopped two groups of children who were being taken by unrelated adults by bus in different districts. The children are being held in government shelters and police are still investigating the cases.
Thousands of children are taken from Nepal to neighbouring India every year to work as child labourers or in brothels.
The earthquakes on 25 April and 12 May killed at least 8,673 people in Nepal.
