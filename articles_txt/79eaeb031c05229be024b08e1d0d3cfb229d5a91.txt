CARSON CITY — Nevada senators have passed a proposal growing the state's minimum wage and modifying how overtime hours are calculated.
Senators voted 11-9 on celebration lines to approve SB193 on Friday. The bill now moves to the Assembly.
The bill raises minimum wage for staff devoid of employer-offered health insurance to $9 an hour and removes quite a few guidelines governing how overtime is calculated.
Democrats opposed the bill saying it wouldn't alter the $7.25 wage for workers with employer-provided overall health care and that it would not pretty compensate workers with longer shifts.
Republicans rejected 4 Democrat-sponsored amendments escalating the proposed wage bump and modifying the overtime calculations.
