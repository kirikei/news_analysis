The executive who oversaw PG&E’s utility operation during the deadly San Bruno pipeline blast and the company’s turbulent aftermath will retire at the end of the year, company officials announced Tuesday.
Christopher Johns , president of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the utility wing of PG&E Corp., was hired in 1996 to help manage the utility’s finances. But it was his promotion to the electric company’s top job in 2009, a year before an exploding gas line killed eight people, that marked his tenure at the organization.
PG&E officials said Johns was a committed leader who worked to achieve “international recognition for gas safety performance” for the company. Some say he implemented reforms needed to make PG&E more secure in the wake of the 2010 disaster.

The company has not named a replacement.
“We found Mr. Johns to be very straightforward and easy to work with,” said San Bruno City Manager Connie Jackson , who has partnered with PG&E in repairing damage to the neighborhood where 38 homes were destroyed five years ago. “That said, we’re not surprised that he’s leaving. … We do hold him and the other executives with decision-making authority at the time of the explosion accountable.”
The disaster resulted in a record $1.6 billion penalty for the utility, with state regulators citing PG&E’s shoddy record-keeping and reckless safety practices leading up to the blast.
The company has pledged to better secure its 6,750 miles of gas lines, but regulators as recently as last month said the company is still plagued by gas-system problems and may be too big to operate safely.
The utility has also been criticized for nourishing too cozy of a relationship with regulators at the California Public Utilities Commission . Federal and state prosecutors are currently investigating whether commission officials have violated any laws.
Johns joins a handful at the company, including former CEO Peter Darbee , to announce their departure since the San Bruno blast.
PG&E officials said they plan to address the vacancy before Johns’ retirement becomes effective Dec. 31.
“We are fortunate to have developed a deep bench,” said PG&E Chairman and CEO Tony Earley in a prepared statement.
“We thank Chris for his exemplary commitment and service,” he said. “He has been a tireless supporter for our people as they work together in communities throughout Northern and Central California to deliver outstanding operational performance that, in 2014, included record electric reliability, international recognition for gas safety performance and the highest customer service ratings since 2009.”
