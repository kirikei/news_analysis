India heatwave kills 800 as capitals roads melt
Wednesday, May 27, 2015 - Hyderabad, IndiaAt least 800 people have died in a major heatwave that has swept across India, melting roads in New Delhi as temperatures neared 50 degrees Celsius.
Hospitals were on alert to treat victims of heatstroke and authorities advised people to stay indoors with no end in sight to the searing conditions. In the worst-hit state of Andhra Pradesh, in the south, 551 people have died in the last week as temperatures hit 47 degrees Celsius on Monday.
The state government has taken up education programmes through television and other media to tell people not to venture into the outside without a cap, to drink water and other measures, said P. Tulsi Rani, special commissioner for disaster management in the state. We have also requested NGOs and government organisations to open up drinking water camps so that water will be readily available for all the people in the towns.Large parts of India, including the capital New Delhi, have endured days of sweltering heat, prompting fears of power cuts as energy-guzzling air conditioners work overtime.
The Hindustan Times daily said the maximum temperature in the capital hit a two-year high of 45.5 degrees Celsius on Monday  five degrees higher than the seasonal average.
The paper carried a front-page photo of a main road in the city melting in the heat, its zebra pedestrian crossing stripes curling and spreading into the asphalt. Its baking hot out here  our outing has turned into a nightmare, said Meena Sheshadri, a 37-year-old tourist from the western city of Pune who was visiting Delhis India Gate monument with her children.
My throat is parched, even though Ive been constantly sipping water.
In Telangana state, which borders Andhra Pradesh in the south, 231 people have died in the last week as temperatures hit 48 degrees Celsius over the weekend. In the western state of Orissa 11 people were confirmed to have died from the heat. Indias Meteorological Department issued a Red Box warning for the state Tuesday and Wednesday  meaning the maximum temperatures would remain above 45 degrees Celsius.AFP
