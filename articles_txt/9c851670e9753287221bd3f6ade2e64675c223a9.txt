CHICAGO -- After surviving an unexpectedly tough campaign for a second term, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Wednesday that Chicago's challenges "don't need to be made harder if I have a stylistic issue" but gave few details about how he'll change his approach.
Emanuel was re-elected with a double-digit victory over Cook County Commissioner Jesus "Chuy" Garcia on Tuesday. But the former White House chief of staff failed to win an outright majority in February, despite a massive advantage in fundraising and name recognition over four challengers.
In the second campaign burst, the famously aggressive mayor said he'd soften his approach.
"If my style, as I said on the campaign, contributed and made what is already a hard issue harder, I own that," Emanuel said.
But when asked how he planned to alter his management style, he said there wasn't a checklist.
His administration must negotiate a new contract with the Chicago Teachers Union. The last round of talks between Emanuel and the union led to Chicago's first teachers strike in 25 years. Tensions deepened in 2013 when Emanuel pushed to close dozens of neighborhood schools.
Emanuel also must address the worst pension crisis of any major U.S. city. Chicago's four pension systems are about $20 billion in debt, and the fund for Chicago Public Schools teachers is short about $7 billion of what's needed to pay benefits as promised.
