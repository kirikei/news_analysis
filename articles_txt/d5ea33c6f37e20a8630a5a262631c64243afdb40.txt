Periscope, the cool new live videos streaming app from Twitter, is finally available for Andorid devices.
A blog post from Medium Corporation which created the app announced that Android owners using Version 4.4 (KitKat) and above can download Periscope from Google Play.

While Periscope on Android will be similar to the popular iOS version, it incorporates elements of material design and gives Android users more controls over push notifications. “Android users have granular control over additional Push Notification settings, such as “First Time Broadcast notifications” (when somebody you follow on Twitter broadcasts on Periscope for the first time) and “Share notifications” (when somebody you follow on Periscope shares somebody else’s broadcast),” says the post. Plus there is the “Resume notification” feature, “so you can keep watching where you left off in case your broadcast gets interrupted (by a phone call or message)”.
Live streaming on Twitter became a fad a few months back with the launch of the Meerkat app. However, Twitter was quick to cash in on the opportunity and acquired Periscope.
However, Android users need to be aware that a live stream of your fish tank of your kid’s stage performance in school could end up burning your monthly data quota within minutes, unless you are using a Wi-Fi stream.
