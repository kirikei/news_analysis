Despite the president’s sagging approval ratings in 2014 and the strong Republican performance in the midterm elections, the Democrats retain a nine-point advantage among adult Americans who lean toward a party identification, 48 to 39.
The tally is nearly unchanged from the 10-point Democratic advantage in 2012, when President Obama won re-election.
The stability of the Democratic advantage in party identification suggests that disappointment with President Obama’s performance hasn’t caused traditionally Democratic voters to reassess their partisanship. That’s a very different reaction from Republicans in the middle part of the last decade, when dissatisfaction with the Bush administration allowed Democrats to build the wide advantage that persists today.
Democrats Struggle Again to Attract White Voters

Non-Hispanic whites lean Republican by a nine-point margin, one of the G.O.P.’s largest advantages among white voters over the last 20 years. But the G.O.P. advantage is about the same as in 2004, when Republicans had an eight-point advantage, and 2012, when it was a seven-point advantage.
Notably, there isn’t much evidence of a trend against Democrats. Since 2010, the Republican advantage has held between 7 and 11 points.

Perhaps because of the growing Democratic affinity for liberal cultural politics, Republicans have made steady gains among white evangelical and Catholic voters over the last decade.
Since 2004, the Republican advantage among white evangelicals has grown by 12 points, from 34 to 46 points. Over all, 68 percent of white evangelicals lean Republican, compared with just 22 percent leaning Democratic.
The traditional Democratic advantage among white Catholics — who were equally likely to lean Republican or Democratic in 2004 — has turned into a modest and persistent Republican advantage for five straight years, including a nine-point G.O.P. edge in 2014.
Younger Millennials Lean Democratic
They’re nearly as Democratic as older millennials, and far more Democratic than other voters.

Political scientists delight in debating about the political leanings of the young voters who reached voting age after President Obama’s 2008 election. One theory has held that younger millennials will be significantly more Republican than older millennials, since their politics would be defined by the Obama years, not by opposition to the Bush administration. Others have argued that Democratic strength among younger voters is the result of cultural and demographic changes, not the national political conditions of the end of the last decade.
The Pew data, which includes 2,693 voters who are 18 to 25, suggests that the youngest millennials are about as Democratic as older millennials. The youngest millennials lean Democratic by 15 points; older millennials lean Democratic by 17 points. Fifty-one percent of the youngest millennials lean Democratic, compared with 50 percent of older millennials.

There is, however, one intriguing weak spot for Democrats among the youngest millennials: minorities. While young whites are far more Democratic than their elders, the youngest nonwhite adults tend to be somewhat more Republican than their elders.
According to the Pew data, 17 percent of 18- to 25-year-old black adults lean Republican — far more than any other age group among blacks. The sample is small — there were just 354 black adults between the ages of 18 and 25 queried — but it is not the only piece of evidence supporting this possibility. In the 2012 exit polls, just 80 percent of black men 18 to 29 supported Mr. Obama, although the number of respondents was quite low.
The Pew data also shows Republicans faring somewhat better among the youngest Hispanics. Thirty-two percent of the youngest Hispanics lean Republican, but Republicans didn’t exceed 26 percent with any other age bracket among Hispanics.
The Pew data isn’t enough to definitively state that the Republicans are faring better among the youngest nonwhite voters, but it’s something to keep an eye on.
