Jenkins worked out for the team last week along with a few other wideouts. He was a first-round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers .
The Illinois product did not catch a pass in his rookie year and was traded to the Chiefs for wide receiver Jon Baldwin in 2013. In February, the Chiefs released Jenkins.
At 6-0, 200 lbs., Jenkins has 17 career receptions for 223 yards. In his senior year (2011) for the Illini, Jenkins collected 90 caches for 1,276 yards and eight touchdowns. He also had a career total of 38 kick returns for 773 yards and one touchdown. Watch some of his collegiate highlights in the video embedded below.
The Cowboys are looking for a No. 5 receiver and return man with the departure of wide receiver Dwayne Harris . Jenkins does have some speed and should be fighting for the spot with OTAs starting up. At the 2012 NFL Scouting Combine, Jenkins ran a 4.39s 40-yard dash.
The Cowboys are hoping the former first rounder can return to his old form.
