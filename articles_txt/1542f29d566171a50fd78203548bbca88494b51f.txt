CONCORD, New Hampshire — A key House committee is preparing to take public testimony on a bill that would legalize two casinos in New Hampshire.
The House Ways and Means Committee, which has previously rejected casino proposals, will hold a public hearing Tuesday morning. Casino gambling has never won approval in the House, but an endorsement from the committee would improve its chances this year.
The bill is similar to one before lawmakers last year. It would license one large and one smaller casino for $120 million in initial licensing fees. Casino backers are hoping the state's budgeting woes may prompt new support for the bill. They say legalizing casinos would bring in non-tax revenue that could help the state fund its priorities without raising taxes or fees.
