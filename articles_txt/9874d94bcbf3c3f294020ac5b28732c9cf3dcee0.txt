In January, ethics questions were raised after Cowboys owner Jerry Jones paid for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to travel to Dallas for a playoff game. Now more questions are being raised about the Jones-Christie relationship.
Prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating how a company owned by Jones got the lease for the observatory at the new One World Trade Center. The World Trade Center is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is controlled by Christie and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.
At this point, prosecutors have only opened an investigation, and there is no allegation of wrongdoing. Christie has said his friendship with Jones began only after the Port Authority awarded Jones’s company the contract.
The office of the Manhattan District Attorney confirmed that it has subpoenaed records pertaining to “the procurement process for the award of the lease.”
