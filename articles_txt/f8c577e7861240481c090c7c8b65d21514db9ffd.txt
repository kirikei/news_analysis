President Obama and his household spent Easter Sunday at a historic black church in Virginia as the minister gave a sermon that mixed politics and scripture.
Obama was joined by wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia at the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria. For the holiday, they also posed for an official White Home photo.
The church’s pastor, the Rev. Howard-John Wesley, 42, who like Michelle Obama is a native of Chicago’s South Side, gave a rousing sermon about the duty of selection.
“Where do you stand with rights for exact same-sex couples . . . exactly where do you stand on gun reform, where do you stand with police body cameras?” Wesley asked the congregation. “Even currently in our political landscape, a line in the sand is drawn forcing you to make a selection on where you stand.”
The church, which dates to 1803, is identified for its liberal positions, such as its support for civil rights for similar-sex couples, according to the Washington Post.
“It was an honor to just worship with the President,” Wesley told the Post.
But at one point, as excited worshipers gave Obama the rock star remedy, Wesley warned them: “This is not selfie time. Let the brother worship in the residence of God.”
