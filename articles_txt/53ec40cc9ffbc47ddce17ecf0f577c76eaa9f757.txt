KABUL The Taliban claimed responsibility for an overnight attack on a guesthouse in the diplomatic enclave of the Afghan capital that ended on Wednesday morning after a stand-off with Afghan government forces.
The Afghan interior ministry said the militants had been armed with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and other weapons. All four attackers were killed and no other casualties were reported.
