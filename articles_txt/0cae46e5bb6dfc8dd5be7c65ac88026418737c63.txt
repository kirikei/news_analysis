PARIS: Twice former champion Serena Williams made a low-key start to her French Open campaign with a 6-2 6-3 victory over Czech qualifier Andrea Hlavackova yesterday.
The world number one, eyeing a 20th grand slam singles title, raced into a 3-0 lead but was given a decent workout after that by a player she beat 6-0 6-0 in their only previous meeting three years ago at the US Open.
Hlavackova broke the mighty Williams serve in the fifth game, but the first set was otherwise mostly one way traffic as the American unloaded some heavy groundstrokes under grey skies on a cool day on court Philippe Chatrier.
In the second, the veteran American played with clinical economy, winning the only break point she got and saving both of those she faced.
Williams, who has already bagged the Australian Open crown this year, last won the title in Paris in 2013 and has reached the quarter-finals or better eight times, but she crashed out in round two last year to Spaniard Garbine Muguruza.
Doing worse in an event than a year ago costs players world ranking points.
Arch rival and defending champion Maria Sharapova, also looking for a third French Open title, awaits at the other end of the draw in a potential final.
Exit
Earlier yesterday, Canadian sixth seed Bouchard, a semi-finalist in 2014, crashed out at the hands of France's Kristina Mladenovic.
Bouchard went down 6-4, 6-4 to the world number 44, her eighth defeat in her last nine matches.
Also going out was Bulgarian 10th seed Dimitrov who suffered his second successive first-round exit in Paris, losing 7-6 (9/7), 6-2, 6-3 to Jack Sock of the United States.
Wimbledon champion and fourth seed Petra Kvitova needed two and a half hours to see off New Zealand's world number 80 Marina Erakovic 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, getting broken six times and committing 47 unforced errors.
Serbian 25th seed Jelena Jankovic, a three-time semi-finalist, suffered her first opening-round loss in a decade when she went down 6-3, 6-4 to Bulgarian qualifier Sesil Karatantcheva.
Spain's David Ferrer won his 300th claycourt match when he swept past Slovakia's Lukas Lacko, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1.
Svetlana Kuznetsova, the 2009 champion, beat Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 and will next face 2010 winner Francesca Schiavone of Italy.
