On Thursday, bells will ring in Hillsboro and Greenfield as part of Bells Across the Land, a national event commemorating the 150th anniversary of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House, Virginia in 1865.
While Lee’s surrender on April 9, 1865 didn’t end the Civil War, it “signaled the end of the Southern states’ attempt to create a separate nation,” according to the National Park Service website.
On April 9, 2015 at 3 p.m., bells will ring at Appomattox for four minutes, according to the National Park Service, then at 3:15 p.m. bells will ring across the country as communities join in. Bells are to ring for four minutes, one minute for each year of the war.
During those four years of the Civil War, men from across Highland County joined in the bloody battles that pitted countryman against countryman.
In Greenfield, bells will ring at the City Building, Greenfield Schools, First Baptist Church, First Presbyterian Church, and the Greenfield Historical Society.
In Hillsboro, bells will ring at St. Mary’s Episcopal Church.
According to the National Park Service website on the event, “churches, temples, schools, city halls, public buildings, historic sites, and others are invited to ring bells” beginning at 3:15 p.m. on Thursday.
For those interested in participating, there is no need to contact anyone, just join in at 3:15 p.m. on Thursday and let the bells ring for four minutes.
