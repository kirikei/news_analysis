Cleveland, OH (SportsNetwork.com) - Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving is in the starting lineup for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Atlanta Hawks.
Irving missed the last two games due to a lingering knee injury, but the Cavs won both without him to take a commanding 3-0 series lead.
Irving, who is averaging 18.9 points and 3.5 assists in 11 playoff games this postseason, aggravated the injury in Cleveland's 97-89 Game 1 win. He played just 28 minutes, down eight minutes from his playoff average, and scored 10 points with six assists.
