CHICAGO (FOX 32 News) -
The headline of a Chicago Tribune article is “Garcia presses to turn negatives into positive against Rahm Emanuel” but the big news here? The Tribune quotes Garcia as saying he would “lose the election right off the bat” if he offered specific tax increases to solve the city's pension and budget problems.
Garcia dodged questions after a Saturday afternoon rally at New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church but his supporter Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr. dismissed the Tribune article, “It's a diversion. What's important is vacant lots and abandoned houses. What's important is on the near north side unemployment is less than 3% and in the [audible] it's 30%,” said Jackson.
“Until you have an audit you don't know what you're dealing with,” said Jackson in an interview with Fox 32's Tisha Lewis.
“He actually has released a plan online but he cannot release a detailed plan until he knows what's going on like the rest of us, we don't know,” said Sara Sayigh.
Even so, Mayor Rahm Emanuel slammed Garcia's vagueness on the city's financial crisis.
“If you tell people, I can't tell you who is on my unelected, unaccountable commission because I'm not at liberty to tell you but the one thing I will tell, if I told you, you won't elect me, I don't need more. You told me everything I need to know,” said Emanuel.
Political Analyst Thom Serafin says Garcia's “lose the election right off the bat” comment is counterproductive.
“It shows inexperience and staff inexperience on his part,” said Serafin.
Serafin also points out Garcia's controversial comment is true.
“Chuy is doing the right thing saying I can't do anything until I get in and take a look at the books but he hasn't done a good job explaining that, speaking to those issues. He hasn't done a good job on the campaign trail talking about that,” said Serafin.
