Superior, WI (NNCNOW.com) -- Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, who hopes to be re-elected to the Court, swung through Superior Easter Sunday on her campaign trail.
Her main mission is to keep political parties out of the judiciary. Bradley also says no to out of state special interest money. She is running against James Daley from southwest Wisconsin.
Her most controversial stance is that she does not want to accept a new constitutional amendment which would change the way Wisconsin selects its Chief Justice; she thinks that amendment would change the Court for decades.
Bradly says we are headed in the wrong direction in judicial races. She has spent 30 years as a judge, and 20 years on the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court election in Wisconsin is this coming Tuesday.
