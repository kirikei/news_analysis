There should be no e-mail server issues this time.
Hillary Rodham Clinton has hired a Google executive as chief technology officer for her likely presidential campaign, a person familiar with the planning said Wednesday.

Stephanie Hannon, Google’s director of product management for civic innovation and social impact, is becoming head of Clinton’s technology operations, according to the source.
Clinton, 67, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, came under intense criticism for using a private e-mail server housed in her home for official communications when she was secretary of state.
Clinton is expected to make her official announcement later this month and has signed a lease for a Brooklyn office to house her campaign.
Presidential candidates from both parties are hiring digital advisors who can help them build Web sites and apps to interact with voters and try new fundraising techniques.
Hannon previously worked on Google Maps and Gmail and worked shorter stints at Facebook and event organizing site Eventbrite, according to her LinkedIn profile. Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
