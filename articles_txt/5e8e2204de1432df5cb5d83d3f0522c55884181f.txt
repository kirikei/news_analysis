Henry County participated in the world’s largest fundraising movement for the American Cancer Society May 2. The county held its annual Relay for Life in Headland.
“The relay went great,” said Joy Brigham, community manager for Relay for Life. “The weather cooperated with us, and we had great entertainment provided throughout the event.”
The goal for the 2015 Henry County Relay for Life was set at $40,000.
“We were a little short on meeting our goal by the night of the relay,” Brigham said. “So far, we have raised $37,000. However, fund-raising events are still taking place, and additional events will be scheduled in the near future to help us reach our goal. The cutoff date has been set for August 31. We feel we will meet our goal by cutoff.”
Henry County had 19 teams participate in the relay. More than 200 individuals attended to honors those who have won the fight and those who gave their all during their fight.
“All of our teams worked very hard in making sure this year’s event was a success, and it was,” Brigham said. “All funds raised during the event will go to help win the fight against cancer. The best news we can share is we had around 90 individuals participate in our survivor dinner. That is amazing, and we thank each and every one of them. That alone is something to cheer about. The dinner was a huge success, and we thank each and every one of our sponsors who helped make the dinner possible to honor those who have won the fight.”
The Henry County Relay for Life Committee thanks the following sponsors for their participation in either the relay or the survivor dinner. They are FatBacks, H&H Construction, H&M Food Equipment, Pea River Electric, HNB First, Abbeville Kiwanis, Dr. Jimmy King, Carter’s Trophy, Alabama Power Company, Herndon Oil, Great Southern Wood, Henry County Health and Rehabilitation, Southeast Alabama Gas District, Wells Fargo, Billy’s Paint and Body and Headland Family Medicine.
“We could not have pulled off this event, if it were not for all of our sponsors,” Brigham said. “Each of the sponsors went above and beyond in helping us with this year’s relay. This year’s theme was ‘Be a Hero, Fight Back against Cancer.’ We definitely had our share of soldiers who have either won their battle or are fighting their battle. We also honored those who gave everything they had during their fight against cancer. That is why this event is so important. We all want a cure, and every dime goes towards, hopefully, finding that cure.”
