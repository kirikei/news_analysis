DENVER (AP) - Republicans get their last chance of the year Monday to change Coloradoâ€™s firearm laws. Lawmakers will consider several proposals, including two bills to eliminate gun-control measures passed by Democrats in 2013.
The GOP-controlled Senate has already passed legislation to repeal a 15-round limit on ammunition magazines. They also passed and new background-check requirements for private gun sales conducted online and in person. Those laws from two years ago infuriated gun rights advocates and led to the recalls of two Democratic state senators, and the resignation of a third who was facing a recall effort.
The Democrat-led House committee hearing the bills Monday is expected to reject them. Other proposals expected to go down include bills to allow concealed handguns at public schools, and to let people to carry concealed firearms without a permit.
