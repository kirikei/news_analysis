TALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/AP) — In a flip flop from Rick Scott, the governor now says he is opposed to the state expanding Medicaid.
In a statement Monday, Scott expressed concern that the federal government might not make good on their promise to fund Medicaid for an additional 800,000 Floridians.
Scott and the Legislature have been in intense negotiations with the federal government to extend more than $1 billion dollars in hospital grants. But the feds have said no and the disagreement has spilled over to Medicaid expansion.
Scott originally opposed expansion, but in an emotional speech two years ago he came out in support.
Scott’s new withdrawl of support for an expansion of Medicaid in the state has crippled Tallahassee lawmakers as they finalize a new state budget before the end of the session on May 1st.
