Sources: Callaspo trade between #Braves and #Dodgers back on. Braves pulled Callaspo from lineup. Six-player deal. Uribe would go to ATL.
Rosenthal says the trade is done  and is only awaiting approval from the commissioner’s office.
Uribe is making $6.5 million this season in the final year of a two-year, $15 million deal. Getting him out of Los Angeles would allow the Dodgers to give more regular playing time to Cuban slugger Alex Guerrero .

Callapso probably got a brain when the Barves told him that in a couple of weeks, he could be traded to a last place team instead of the Dollars.
That said, who else is involved as far as the prospects?
