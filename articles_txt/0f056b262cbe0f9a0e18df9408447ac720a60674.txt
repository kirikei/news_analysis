SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources says the peregrine falcon nest in downtown Salt Lake City might not have any eggs this year.
The Salt Lake Tribune reports ( http://bit.ly/1J1c8Ga) that the bird has been acting depressed and lost her appetite.
DWR's Watchable Wildlife Coordinator Bob Walters said he received a call on Sunday from the Joseph Smith Memorial Building security staff. They reported that the bird was acting strangely on the grounds nearby.
Walters captured the falcon and put it in the care of a local wildlife rehabilitator.
DWR is waiting for the results of a blood test to determine whether the bird has a respiratory disease.
