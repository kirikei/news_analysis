Juan Uribe bids adieu to Dodgers with trade to Braves apparent
LOS ANGELES --  Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Juan Uribe said Tuesday night he was told a trade with the Atlanta Braves would be made official either later that night or Wednesday morning.
According to reports, the Dodgers will receive Alberto Callaspo , left-handed pitchers Eric Stults and Ian Thomas and right-handed pitcher Juan Jaime in exchange for Uribe and right-hander Chris Withrow , who is recovering from Tommy John and back surgeries and is not expected to pitch in 2015.
Juan Uribe, when asked Tuesday night what he would miss about playing for the Dodgers, got choked up, pointed toward the team's clubhouse, excused himself and walked away.

Uribe, when he was asked what he would miss about playing for the Dodgers, got choked up, pointed toward the team's clubhouse, where his teammates were getting dressed after an 8-0 win over the Braves, excused himself and walked away.
Uribe was not in the Dodgers' dugout after the playing of the national anthem. The Dodgers did not confirm the trade after the game.
A deal that would have sent Uribe to the Braves for Callaspo had been blocked by Callaspo earlier in the day. 
But the Braves announced about 15 minutes before the first pitch that Pedro Ciriaco was replacing Callaspo at third base and batting in the seventh spot.
According to MLB.com, Callaspo told the Braves he was willing to accept the trade, which was awaiting the approval of commissioner Rob Manfred.
Under the collective bargaining agreement, Callaspo had the right to refuse a trade until June 15 because he signed with the Braves as a free agent last offseason. Callaspo had previously told reporters he rejected the trade because he liked his teammates and wanted to finish the season in Atlanta. 
The Dodgers viewed Alberto Callaspo as a better option off the bench because he rarely strikes out and has been adept at times in his career at getting on base.

Uribe, 36, was a key piece of the Dodgers' NL West-leading 2014 team, batting .311 with nine home runs and playing stellar defense at third base.
But the hot hitting of Justin Turner and Alex Guerrero allowed them to push ahead of Uribe on the Dodgers' depth chart at third base. In addition, Cuban defector Hector Olivera is working out at the team's facility in Arizona and could join the mix at the position as soon as a month from now. 
"He never fell from grace. Juan has never done anything wrong," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "In professional sports, the guy that performs is the one who plays for the most part."
The Dodgers viewed Callaspo as a better option off the bench because he rarely strikes out and has been adept at times in his career at getting on base.
Uribe is making $6.5 million this season. Callaspo is making $3 million.
The proposed trade started brewing before Monday night's 6-3 Dodgers win against the Braves at Dodger Stadium. Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez said after the game that Callaspo had been scratched 20 minutes before first pitch because of a potential deal.
"We didn't want him to get hurt," Gonzalez said. "So, that was the reason he got taken out of the lineup."

LOS ANGELES â That guy certainly looked familiar.
Amid all the speculation and overwrought, numbers-crunching analysis about whatâs wrong with Clayton Kershaw, everything looked very right with him Tuesday night. Kershaw turned in his best start of the season in an 8-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.
Kershaw held the Braves hitless through four innings and scoreless through seven before handing the ball over to the bullpen. It was the first time in 10 starts this season Kershaw turned in a scoreless performance. He had seven last season.
âI guess Iâm indifferent. I donât really care, I guess,â Kershaw said when asked how he had taken the constant comparisons between this yearâs results (he is now 3-3 with a 3.86 ERA) and his MVP-Cy Young run last summer. âIâm just trying to win, trying to pitch. People are going to have opinions and thatâs great. I guess people have high expectations of me too, which is great. But at the end of the day, I only care about what my teammates and coaches think. If they see something they want to tell me, great. If anybody else does, I donât really care.
âThereâs stuff wrong. Youâre giving up runs. I think itâs not a âWhatâs wrong?â I think itâs just minor tweaks here and there.â
There was little wrong Tuesday. He retired the first 12 batters in order, allowed just four hits, struck out 10 and didnât walk a batter. It is the ninth time in his career he has paired a double-digit strikeout game with a no-walk outing. He did it three times last season but this was the first this season.
âHe wasnât too bad tonight,â Dodgers manager Don Mattingly deadpanned. âItâs been a lot of the same. Tonight he got the zeroes.
âHis stuff has been similar all along. I feel I like Iâve been defending him but he doesnât need defending. Heâs been throwing the ball well. Tonight, he got better results as far as runs on the board.â
The Braves did threaten twice against Kershaw. They put runners at first and second with one out in the fifth after Nick Markakis broke up Kershawâs no-hit bid with a leadoff single. But Kershaw got Pedro Ciriaco to ground out on a nice play by second baseman Howie Kendrick and struck out Christian Bethancourt, overpowering him with a 94-mph fastball.
In the seventh, Markakis led off with a double and moved to third on a wild pitch to the next batter. But Kershaw stranded him there by striking out Jonny Gomes, overmatching Andrelton Simmons for another strikeout and getting Ciriaco to ground out again.
That capped Kershawâs most complete game of the season â stuff matching results â if not a complete game.
âYeah, I guess so,â Kershaw agreed. âThat fifth inning could have gotten away from me. Made some mistakes there. Howie made a great play defensively. â¦ Being able to get out of that unscathed was huge for me.â
By then, the Dodgers offense had continued its revival and made Kershaw comfortable with a six-run fourth inning against Braves starter Julio Teheran. The six-run burst is the biggest inning of the season for the Dodgers, who have now scored 14 runs in their past two games after scoring a total of nine in their previous eight games.
Kendrick and Justin Turner had RBI singles in the big inning. Andre Ethier drove in two with a double and A.J. Ellis one with another double. Kershaw even joined in the effort, dropping a two-out RBI single into center field to cap the six-run inning.
An inning later, Adrian Gonzalez added a two-run home run. The homer pushed Gonzalez past the 1,000-RBI mark for his career. He is one of only 12 active players with 1,000 career RBI.
âAdrianâs pretty amazing really,â said Mattingly who finished his 14-year career with 1,099 RBI. âDay in, day out. Year in, year out. This guy just keeps going. I think heâs that guy for a manager that makes everything pretty easy.
âYou know heâs going to be ready to play. Heâs always prepared. Heâs really good for other guys as far as understanding what to do against certain pitchers. You know heâs going to have a gameplan every night for every guy. He never walks up there without one.â
Gonzalez acknowledged 1,500 RBI as somewhat of a target for him but admitted he took pride in the consistent production this milestone represents.
âItâs a little bit of everything,â he said. âYou definitely have to stay healthy if youâre going to get there. And you have to stay productive to stay on the field and be in a starting lineup for this is my 10th season now.â
