Mitt Romney is in the top one percent of bracketeers
Mitt Romney remains firmly in the one percent as his March Madness bracket manages even to impress the Huffington Post .
“Mitt Romney’s NCAA Bracket Is Ridiculously Good” ran the headline of a story which later admitted “Romney’s NCAA tournament bracket this year is almost certainly better than yours.
Romney correctly picked six team that would be in the Elite Eight. More importantly, he knew that Wisconsin and Duke would face each other in the championship game.
After the game, Romney tweeted “Should have put $10,000 on my bracket.” He was referring to the uproar in 2011 after he challenged Rick Perry to a $10,000 bet on the position of the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act.
Of the 11.57 million brackets submitted to ESPN this year, Romney’s came in 25,485 place- meaning he is comfortably in the 99.98th percentile of brackets.
Basketball loving and Presidential victor Barak Obama came in 6,918,578 place- meaning he is somewhere in the 40th percentile.
Obama had chosen Kentucky, Arizona, Villanova, and Duke to be in the Final Four.
This is quite a change. During his 2012 campaign, Romney said that he didn’t have time to watch basketball and fill out a bracket.
“I’m not plugged in well enough this year to do that,” said Romney in 2012.
It would seem that having decided not to run for president in 2016 has given Mitt plenty of free time.
