WASHINGTON (AP) — In a presidential campaign, you only get one Opening Day.
The formal kick-off announcement sets the stage for what the most ambitious of politicians hope will be a triumphant march to the White House.
Most are carefully choreographed, some struggle to draw attention. All send a signal to voters about whether they're watching a contender or just another soon-to-be has-been.
Up next is Marco Rubio, who appears ready to enter the race Monday.
He will surely spend the weekend wondering if Hillary Rodham Clinton will ruin his moment with a Sunday night message that she's getting in, too.
