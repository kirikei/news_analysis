Iowa reporters asked Republican Donald Trump on Wednesday morning whether he'd campaign in all 99 counties in Iowa if he runs for president, like Rick Santorum did in 2012 to win the Iowa caucuses.
"Rick and I are very different people, and I don't think people would expect that of me," answered Trump, who invited the Iowa press aboard his private jet shortly after it landed at the Des Moines airport Wednesday.
Trump said he has a full-time job, unlike politicians who spend their time running for office over and over and break promises to voters.
"Rick's a nice guy," Trump added, in an apparent attempt to soften that criticism.
Trump said he has certain advantages over Santorum, who famously ran a shoestring campaign.
"I have a big plane," Trump said. "He doesn't."

Reporters on Wednesday night asked for reaction from Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania and father of seven who started a movie company after the 2012 race.
To get to Iowa, "I flew to O'Hare airport and my plane was canceled, so I took a cab to Midway and took a Southwest flight," answered Santorum, who talked to the press after a speech in West Des Moines.
Santorum said if he gets into the 2016 race — he'll decide by early summer — the fact that he knows the Iowa terrain well will be to his advantage.
