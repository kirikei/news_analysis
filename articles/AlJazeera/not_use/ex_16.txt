The government has called on Egyptian authorities to urgently review the prison sentences imposed on three Al Jazeera journalists, including Australian Peter Greste.
"The seven-year prison sentences appear to be aimed at silencing critics rather than serving justice," Foreign Minister Murray McCully said on Tuesday.
"The Egyptian authorities need to understand the international community is watching closely."
Greste has been jailed for seven years for spreading false news and aiding the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood after the overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.
His colleagues have been handed jail terms of seven and 10 years.
Earlier on Tuesday Prime Minister John Key said the situation was deeply concerning.
"In my view, there's no way that these journalists, on anything I've seen, should be locked up for what was fundamentally doing their job."
