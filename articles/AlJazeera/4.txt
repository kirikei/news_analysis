Egyptian-Canadian Al Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fahmy, who was sentenced to seven years in prison on Monday for spreading false news, has decided to donate LE15,000 to a new initiative launched by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi to assist Egypt through its economic crisis, Reuters' affiliated Aswat Masriya website reported.
Fahmy's brother told Aswat Masriya in a telephone call that his family expects to make the donation on Thursday on behalf of the journalist.
He added that he hopes that the donation will make Egypt's president consider pardoning his brother.
Two Al Jazeera journalists, Australian Peter Greste and Egyptian-Canadian Mohamed Fahmy, were sentenced to seven years in prison on charges including spreading false news, falsely portraying Egypt as being in a state of civil war, as well as aiding or joining the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.
Al Jazeera producer Baher Mohamed was handed two jail terms amounting to 10 years.
Eleven co-defendants, tried in absentia on similar charges, received 10-year terms each, while two others were acquitted.
The verdict received condemnation by many western countries, including the UK, the US and Australia.
Egypt's recently appointed President El-Sisi said on Tuesday he will donate half of his LE42,000 monthly salary and half of his wealth to support the Egyptian economy.
Later on Tuesday, Egyptian media tycoon Mohamed El-Amin said he would donate half of his wealth and a sum equal to a half month's salary from all his employees - likely a considerable amount as he owns three of Egypt's most popular satellite channels.
