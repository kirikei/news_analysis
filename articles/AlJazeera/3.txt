OTTAWA - Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Wednesday that Canada will "advance" its position to Egyptian authorities regarding the case of imprisoned Canadian journalist Mohamed Fahmy.
However, Harper didn't state exactly what position Canada will be advancing, despite criticism from opposition parties and journalist advocacy groups alleging Canada's response to the verdict has been muted.
Harper, who was in Quebec on Wednesday announcing infrastructure funding, refrained from calling for Fahmy's immediate release.
The Egyptian-Canadian Al Jazeera journalist and his two colleagues were sentenced Monday to at least seven years in prison for reporting lies that harmed Egypt's national security and aiding the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, accusations they denied.
The verdict sparked international outrage and Western observers called the trial a sham.
Harper said disagreed with accusations that Canada hasn't properly supported Fahmy.
"We expressed our opposition (to the arrests) from the beginning," Harper said. "Clearly we gave consular services that were as good as possible given the circumstances."
Fahmy and two colleagues will appeal the verdict.
