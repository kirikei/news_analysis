The Press Buzzes About Possible Fox-Time Warner Merger
The basic news story was that Rupert Murdoch-controlled 21st Century Fox had made a $80 billion bid for Time Warner, but the effort was rebuffed and talks had ended for now.
The financial media, however, are having none of that. Instead media outlets from the stately New York Times to the free-wheeling Business Insider are bending over backwards to show that they know how these merger deals really work.
And by their reckoning, it could be just a matter of time and price before a deal is forged, especially because Murdoch has a record of winning over initially resistant shareholders of companies he wants.
"Observers don't expect the rebuff to be the last word in the tango between the magnate and Time Warner," writes Daniel Gross, a Daily Beast columnist. "The prevailing feeling is, if he really wants it, he'll get it."
Adds the New York Times in a front page story: "Mr. Murdoch is determined and unlikely to walk away anytime soon, people briefed on the matter said."

And even the so-called smart-money crowd sees a deal as being highly likely.
Late Thursday, Ken Griffin, chief executive officer of hedge-fund firm Citadel, and Mario Gabelli, CEO of Gamco Investors, told a reporter with Bloomberg News that Murdoch's bid for the media company will be hard to resist, particularly if he comes back with a higher offer.
But aside from Murdoch's obvious tenacity, there's another factor that makes the merger handicappers think that this deal is likely to happen--expected federal government consent.
In a thoughtful column for the New York Times, media columnist David Carr points out that regulators have not opposed other sizable and questionable merger pairings, including Comcast's ( CMCSA CMCSA +0.63% Comcast Corp.

"For the most part, the current government has passed on regulating potential monopolies, and as citizens, we have become inured to the consequences of bigness," writes Carr. "With technology behemoths like Facebook and Google owning part of our everyday lives, we can't get too wound up about which media outfit owns Conan O'Brien's show."
In a lengthy front-page piece Thursday, The Wall Street Journal discusses why these big media companies feel compelled to get even bigger through acquisitions.
"The bid is likely more than a means for Fox to gain scale at a time when pay-TV distributors such as Comcast and AT&T are getting much bigger through their own acquisitions," writes the Journal. "Media moguls like Fox Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch are contemplating a more nuanced problem: How to assemble the right mix of assets--from broadcast channels and sports-television rights to international properties--to stay relevant as the media landscape undergoes tectonic shifts.
"All big media companies are trying to find the magic formula that will inoculate them from the pressures that could come, for example, from customers cutting their pay-TV connections in greater numbers," the article adds. "And they are trying to position themselves to exploit, rather than be buffeted by, the growing viewership of content online and on mobile devices."
For a Street-savvy view of how this dance between the companies could play out, it's worth taking a look at a lengthy piece written by Business Insider CEO and Editor-in-Chief Henry Blodget.
(In 2002, Blodget was accused by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of disparaging stocks in e-mails that Blodget was touting in public as an Internet analyst with Merrill Lynch. He agreed to a permanent ban from the securities industry but has engineered a second act as a financial journalist.)
Blodget writes that Fox's $85-a-share offer for Time Warner "did its job--got everyone's attention--but is viewed on all sides as an opening bid."
He writes that "although there is precedent for Murdoch's opening offer to be his best-and-final offer--he shrewdly and patiently persuaded the shareholders of Dow Jones to accept his opening number, for example--this situation is different. First, Time Warner's shareholders are professional shareholders, not private family members with competing interests. Second, Time Warner's board is not alone in not viewing $85 as a compelling takeout price--Time Warner's shareholders agree with the board. The number seemed especially low considering that the bulk of payment would be delivered in Fox stock (which already has dropped in price)."
Blodget argues that $100 a share does seem to be a reasonable price to make the deal happen. "Sources familiar with both sides of the deal say they would be unhappy with this number, which suggests that it's in the ballpark," he adds.
