ISIL staged 'mass executions' in Tikrit -- rights group

LONDON -- Photograph and satellite imagery indicate that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) insurgents have carried out mass executions in the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, Human Rights Watch reported on Friday.
ISIL, radical Islamists who want to recreate a medieval-style caliphate straddling Iraq and Syria, has stormed largely unopposed across much of northern Iraq, taking cities including Mosul and Tikrit, seizing border posts with Syria and advancing to within about 100km of the capital Baghdad.
New York-based Human Rights Watch said that between 160 and 190 men were killed in at least two locations in and around Tikrit -- the hometown of late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein -- between June 11 and 14.
It said that the death toll could be much higher but the difficulty of locating bodies and getting to the area had prevented a full investigation.
Pictures posted on HRW's website showed a row of men lined up face-down in trenches being shot by gunmen.
"The photos and satellite images from Tikrit provide strong evidence of a horrible war crime that needs further investigation," Human Rights Watch emergencies director Peter Bouckaert said in a statement.
"They and other abusive forces should know that the eyes of Iraqis and the world are watching."
It was not immediately possible to get comment from ISIL.
At least 1,000 killed this month -- UN
The United Nations (UN) said on Tuesday that at least 1,000 people, mainly civilians, had been killed and roughly the same number injured in fighting and other violence in Iraq in June as ISIL swept through the north. Victims included a number of confirmed summary executions committed by ISIL as well as prisoners killed by retreating Iraqi forces.
Human Rights Watch said ISIL posted about 60 photographs on its Twitter feed on June 14, showing fighters loading captives in civilian clothes onto trucks and then forcing them to lie in three shallow trenches.
HRW counted the bodies visible in the available photographs, and estimated that ISIL killed between 90 and 110 men in one trench and between 35 and 40 men in the second.
A further photograph shows a large trench with between 35 and 40 prisoners shot but Human Rights Watch said it had not been able to pinpoint the site.
A UN human rights spokesman said on Tuesday that ISIL had broadcast dozens of videos showing cruel treatment, beheadings and shootings of captured soldiers, police officers and people apparently targeted because of their religion or ethnicity, including Shiites and minorities such as Christians.
Northern units of Iraq's million-strong army, trained and equipped by the US, largely evaporated after Sunni Islamist fighters led by the ISIL launched their assault.
In Tikrit on Friday, Iraqi army helicopters fired on a university campus in an effort to dislodge ISIL fighters, a day after launching an airborne assault on the city.

State of play in Iraq's conflict-hit areas | News24
Baghdad - Sunni militants led by the powerful Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) jihadist group have overrun a swathe of territory north and west of Baghdad in a major offensive.
Here is the state of play in the regions affected by the onslaught.
Mosul: Iraq's second-biggest city, and capital of Nineveh province, was the first to fall in the swift offensive. Hundreds of thousands of residents have fled the city of two million after it was seized by the insurgents.
Tikrit: Militants seized the provincial capital of Salaheddin province and freed hundreds of prisoners as they pushed their advance south. Iraqi forces retaliated with air strikes on the city, hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein.
Tal Afar: The Shi'ite-majority town, located along a strategic northern corridor to Syria, was seized by militants after days of heavy fighting, a local official and witnesses said. But the prime minister's security spokesperson said Iraqi forces were still fighting in the area.
Rabia: Forces from Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region took control of the border crossing with Syria after Iraqi security forces withdrew early in the militant offensive.
Al-Qaim: Militants seized control of the town and the eponymous border crossing with Syria, after fighters loyal to Syrian rebel groups withdrew.
Al-Waleed: With the fall of the border crossing to militants, all three official crossings with Syria are outside Iraqi government control.
Rawa and Ana: Militants have moved into the two towns, pushing their offensive in the desert province of Anbar farther east towards Baghdad after security forces made a "tactical" withdrawal. The militants then killed 21 local leaders in the towns.
Baquba: Militants briefly controlled three areas of the confessionally-mixed capital of restive Diyala province, just 60km north of Baghdad, but were repelled by security forces. During the violence, 44 prisoners in a police station were killed, but accounts conflict over who was responsible for the deaths.
Baiji: After protracted clashes with militants, who held parts of Iraq's biggest oil refinery near Baiji, in Salaheddin province, security forces wrested back full control of the facility. The violence spooked international oil traders.
Kirkuk: The ethnically mixed oil city is the capital of the eponymous northern province. It has changed hands in the course of the offensive. Forces from the autonomous Kurdish region took control of it after federal troops quit the area. The city is the heart of a swathe of disputed territory which the Kurds have long wanted to incorporate into their region, over Baghdad's strong objections. Sunni Arab militants hold a string of towns and surrounding areas west and south of the city.
Samarra: Home to the revered Shiite Al-Askari shrine, whose 2006 bombing sparked a bloody Sunni-Shi'ite sectarian war, the city was attacked by militants but did not fall. Baghdad sent reinforcements.
Baghdad: Though militants have not been able to encroach on the Iraqi capital, the mood is tense. Security forces took on an increased presence, while Shi'ite militias are openly operating.
