ISIL staged 'mass executions' in Tikrit -- rights group

LONDON -- Photograph and satellite imagery indicate that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) insurgents have carried out mass executions in the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, Human Rights Watch reported on Friday.
ISIL, radical Islamists who want to recreate a medieval-style caliphate straddling Iraq and Syria, has stormed largely unopposed across much of northern Iraq, taking cities including Mosul and Tikrit, seizing border posts with Syria and advancing to within about 100km of the capital Baghdad.
New York-based Human Rights Watch said that between 160 and 190 men were killed in at least two locations in and around Tikrit -- the hometown of late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein -- between June 11 and 14.
It said that the death toll could be much higher but the difficulty of locating bodies and getting to the area had prevented a full investigation.
Pictures posted on HRW's website showed a row of men lined up face-down in trenches being shot by gunmen.
"The photos and satellite images from Tikrit provide strong evidence of a horrible war crime that needs further investigation," Human Rights Watch emergencies director Peter Bouckaert said in a statement.
"They and other abusive forces should know that the eyes of Iraqis and the world are watching."
It was not immediately possible to get comment from ISIL.
At least 1,000 killed this month -- UN
The United Nations (UN) said on Tuesday that at least 1,000 people, mainly civilians, had been killed and roughly the same number injured in fighting and other violence in Iraq in June as ISIL swept through the north. Victims included a number of confirmed summary executions committed by ISIL as well as prisoners killed by retreating Iraqi forces.
Human Rights Watch said ISIL posted about 60 photographs on its Twitter feed on June 14, showing fighters loading captives in civilian clothes onto trucks and then forcing them to lie in three shallow trenches.
HRW counted the bodies visible in the available photographs, and estimated that ISIL killed between 90 and 110 men in one trench and between 35 and 40 men in the second.
A further photograph shows a large trench with between 35 and 40 prisoners shot but Human Rights Watch said it had not been able to pinpoint the site.
A UN human rights spokesman said on Tuesday that ISIL had broadcast dozens of videos showing cruel treatment, beheadings and shootings of captured soldiers, police officers and people apparently targeted because of their religion or ethnicity, including Shiites and minorities such as Christians.
Northern units of Iraq's million-strong army, trained and equipped by the US, largely evaporated after Sunni Islamist fighters led by the ISIL launched their assault.
In Tikrit on Friday, Iraqi army helicopters fired on a university campus in an effort to dislodge ISIL fighters, a day after launching an airborne assault on the city.

Guardian News Website - Iraq conflict: Militants 'may have committed war crimes', says UN
SUNNI insurgents in northern Iraq have carried out summary executions of hundreds of captured soldiers, the UN's human rights chief says.
The systematic killings "almost certainly amounted to war crimes," according to Navi Pillay.
Her remarks came as the militants, led by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), were reported to have seized the strategic city of Tal Afar.
The rebels occupied several key cities last week, but some towns were retaken.
Security in Baghdad has been stepped up after the insurgents threatened to march on the capital.
Reports are emerging that an army helicopter has been shot down in fierce clashes near the city of Fallujah, located just 70km (45 miles) west of Baghdad.
President Barack Obama says the United States is deploying up to 275 military personnel to Iraq to protect American interests there.
One reason Tal Afar was important for the government to hold was that the city was the state's only outpost in the entire province of Nineveh, which fell to the Sunni militants last week as the army collapsed.
It is also strategically significant, straddling the main highway from Mosul, the provincial capital, to the Syrian border.
However, assuming Tal Afar has indeed fallen to the militants, it does not mean they have a direct link to Syria - the border crossing at Rabia is controlled on the eastern side by Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, and on the western side by the Popular Protection Units (YPG), the armed wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), which is fiercely hostile to ISIS.
Tal Afar is important for other reasons too. Most of the areas through which the Sunni militants swept last week were largely Sunni populated. Tal Afar has a big Shia community, from the Turkmen minority, perhaps one reason why it held out longer than any other town in Nineveh.
Some observers believe it is important for Iran - which sees itself as the custodian of the Shia - that Tal Afar should not be allowed to fall, and that they would sooner or later wreak revenge, especially if abuses were committed during or after its capture.
