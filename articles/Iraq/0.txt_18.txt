ISIL staged 'mass executions' in Tikrit -- rights group

LONDON -- Photograph and satellite imagery indicate that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) insurgents have carried out mass executions in the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, Human Rights Watch reported on Friday.
ISIL, radical Islamists who want to recreate a medieval-style caliphate straddling Iraq and Syria, has stormed largely unopposed across much of northern Iraq, taking cities including Mosul and Tikrit, seizing border posts with Syria and advancing to within about 100km of the capital Baghdad.
New York-based Human Rights Watch said that between 160 and 190 men were killed in at least two locations in and around Tikrit -- the hometown of late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein -- between June 11 and 14.
It said that the death toll could be much higher but the difficulty of locating bodies and getting to the area had prevented a full investigation.
Pictures posted on HRW's website showed a row of men lined up face-down in trenches being shot by gunmen.
"The photos and satellite images from Tikrit provide strong evidence of a horrible war crime that needs further investigation," Human Rights Watch emergencies director Peter Bouckaert said in a statement.
"They and other abusive forces should know that the eyes of Iraqis and the world are watching."
It was not immediately possible to get comment from ISIL.
At least 1,000 killed this month -- UN
The United Nations (UN) said on Tuesday that at least 1,000 people, mainly civilians, had been killed and roughly the same number injured in fighting and other violence in Iraq in June as ISIL swept through the north. Victims included a number of confirmed summary executions committed by ISIL as well as prisoners killed by retreating Iraqi forces.
Human Rights Watch said ISIL posted about 60 photographs on its Twitter feed on June 14, showing fighters loading captives in civilian clothes onto trucks and then forcing them to lie in three shallow trenches.
HRW counted the bodies visible in the available photographs, and estimated that ISIL killed between 90 and 110 men in one trench and between 35 and 40 men in the second.
A further photograph shows a large trench with between 35 and 40 prisoners shot but Human Rights Watch said it had not been able to pinpoint the site.
A UN human rights spokesman said on Tuesday that ISIL had broadcast dozens of videos showing cruel treatment, beheadings and shootings of captured soldiers, police officers and people apparently targeted because of their religion or ethnicity, including Shiites and minorities such as Christians.
Northern units of Iraq's million-strong army, trained and equipped by the US, largely evaporated after Sunni Islamist fighters led by the ISIL launched their assault.
In Tikrit on Friday, Iraqi army helicopters fired on a university campus in an effort to dislodge ISIL fighters, a day after launching an airborne assault on the city.

If nothing else, Nouri al-Maliki is stubbornly consistent.
In an interview at his Baghdad office a few years ago, the Iraqi prime minister refused to acknowledge that the tension between Iraq's Sunni and Shia citizens was still smouldering outside the protected zone he called home.
It was 2007, the country still reeling from a gruesome sectarian conflict that had claimed the lives of thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands. Bodies were regularly dumped in the streets.
Seven years later, Maliki still wears the air of a man who, despite the evidence to the contrary, knows better.
He still lives in Baghdad's Green Zone and still speaks of Iraqi unity as if it were an innate feature of the fractured nation he rules. But so much has fundamentally changed.
In just a couple of weeks, the ISIS advance through Iraq has served to highlight everything that is wrong with Maliki's Iraq: the disarray and corruption of the armed forces, the absence of loyalty to Baghdad, as well as his inability to foster the unity of which he often speaks.
Most importantly, ISIS's unimpeded march south and west in Iraq -- taking over large swathes of largely Sunni Muslim territory -- demonstrates all the opportunities lost while Maliki's government failed to confront reality.
Sunni Awakening
One of those opportunities was back in 2007. There was, in the midst of all the carnage, a tiny glimmer of hope that Iraq's disgruntled Sunnis could be brought into the new Iraq's fold.

To see evidence of it, we had to travel by U.S. helicopter over Baghdad to a place called Jurf al Sakhr, a town south of the capital where Sunni Muslims who had once been allies of al-Qaeda -- and fierce fighters against U.S. forces -- were now armed and fighting on the U.S. side against the militants.
It was an odd, self-serving alliance on all sides, one smoothed by arms and cold cash, but it was important because it offered the possibility that assumptions about Iraq's disgruntled Sunni community could be broken down.
Even more significantly, that alliance created seven years ago spurned al-Qaeda's vision for Iraq and its Sunni community, a vision that had been embraced by some Sunni Muslims as an alternative to the alienation and marginalization they felt in the new, post-Saddam Iraq.
It was dubbed the Sunni Awakening, and over time the effort began to help tamp down the violence. Crucially, in many parts of Iraq that had previously provided a haven, al-Qaeda was no longer welcome.
It must be stated that the so-called Awakening was only part of the reason that the civil conflict would eventually ebb: there was also the so-called surge that year, which saw thousands more U.S. soldiers flooding into Iraq to help patrol the streets.
The physical separation between Sunni and Shia in Baghdad and elsewhere, brought on by the civil war, also eventually helped bring a modicum of peace. Finally, some of the Shia militias that had been operating unimpeded had chosen to declare ceasefires.

But the Sunni Awakening directly fought extremists who had flourished in areas dominated by disgruntled Sunni Muslims.
It is revealing that ISIS is now operating in precisely those same areas.
Tellingly, ISIS is even more extreme than al-Qaeda, and the two groups fell out as a result. Yet it finds allies among the old, embittered Saddam Baathists in Iraq and ordinary Sunni Muslims alike.
Equally revealing is that in response, after years of Shia Muslims suffering bombings and killings at the hands of extremists, Iraq's Shia militias are back after Maliki called on ordinary Iraqis to protect the capital. One of them marched openly this past weekend, armed to the teeth, on the streets of Baghdad.
Sectarian divisions
The old divisions, while never gone, have been allowed and even encouraged to resurface - on both sides. Dangerously, they are better armed, more entrenched and more disaffected than ever.

Worse, that overt display of sectarianism is being reflected in a region that is already a sectarian tinderbox. Iraq's undoing in the mid-00s uncovered dormant fault lines in Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere.
Brashly in the fore again, Iraq's divisions threaten to drag the entire region, already sore and divided over Syria's sectarian bloodbath, into a parallel conflict.
Iraqis are despairing that they find themselves here again.
Maliki's new plan
Behind the scenes, Maliki is apparently now trying to change course.

With the help of the U.S. -- Secretary of State John Kerry landed in Baghdad today -- Maliki will be negotiating to try to form a more inclusive government, which he is required to do in the coming days now that the election results have been confirmed.
Sunni Muslims, along with Kurds who are also marginalized and tired of Maliki's government, are in a strong negotiating position. Some of them believe Maliki himself must be removed.
The trouble is that Iraq's problems are much, much bigger than one man.
The argument, advanced even by the country's highest Shia Muslim authority, is that those problems could be made smaller with the right person at the helm.
That's probably done easily enough. But how do you now pull back two irregular armies intent on annihilating each other?
