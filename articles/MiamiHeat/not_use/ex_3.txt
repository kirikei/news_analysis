Now it's come full circle.
When LeBron James left Cleveland for Miami four years ago, some very creative YouTube user remade the infamous video of Hulk Hogan turning heel and joining the NWO to feature James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, David Stern and the Cavaliers mascot.
The video went viral and has been viewed nearly 1.5 million times.
Today, we bring you the sequel. Lebron, in a WWE ring, turning on Wade and Bosh.
Sadly, the only thing that's missing is Jim Ross on the call.
UPDATE: A few @TheBuzzerOnFox Twitter followers pointed out that this video, featuring old-school WWF football, LeBron, Pat Riley and Dan Gilbert, should also be included in this post. They are 100 percent correct.
