Entertainer Harris convicted of indecent assaults | euronews, world news
A jury in London has found veteran broadcaster and entertainer Rolf Harris guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault.
The Australian-born 84 year-old celebrity was convicted of the crimes on four girls aged between seven and nineteen years-old between the late 1960s and mid 1980s.
"Rolf Harris has habitually denied any wrongdoing, forcing his victims to recount their ordeal in public. He committed many offences in plain sight of people as he thought his celebrity status placed him above the law. I want to thank the women who came forward for their bravery. I hope that today's guilty verdict will give them closure and help them begin to move on with their lives," said Michael Orchard, Detective Chief Inspector of the Metropolitan Police.
Harris was released on bail until Friday when he will be sentenced.
The judge in the case, Mr Justice Sweeney, said it was "inevitable" a custodial sentence would be possible but has requested a medical report before his final decision.
