Rolf Harris: Footage emerges of him laughing and joking with Jimmy Savile - Telegraph
Meanwhile Harris, who is wearing a mustard yellow sweatshirt, with Rolf across the back, presents him with a signed caricature sketch.
After being presented with the finished portrait, Savile remarks: "I see strong character lines. I see liquid brown eyes and I see the firm jutting chin ... altogether it makes a horrible sight."
Harris laughs: "It looks nothing like you."
It has also now emerged that Savile showed Harris on a visit to Broadmoor prison, where he was such a regular that he even had his own set of keys.
A spokesman for the West London Mental Health NHS Trust said: "Rolf Harris visited Broadmoor Hospital on one occasion in 1973.
"He was escorted by staff at all times and there is no suggestion of any inappropriate behaviour or incident occurring during the visit.
"We cannot say with certainty whether Jimmy Savile accompanied him on this visit, but we believe he may have."
