Compensation claims could see Rolf Harris lose his PS11 million fortune - Telegraph
NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said they had received an "explosion of calls" in the last 24 hours from people concerned about sexual abuse.
He said: "I think this case is symptomatic of an increased confidence that people have now to seek justice for crimes that have been committed against them."
It raises the prospect of some of his victims launching civil claims for damages, which could run into millions.
A large chunk of his money is tied up in the PS5 million Thames-side home in Bray he owns with his wife, Alwen.
The couple bought the house in 1980 and there is no mortgage outstanding.
The bulk of his assets appear to be owned through two companies - Rolf Harris Enterprises Ltd and RHE Investments Ltd.
The first company holds PS2,080,528, while RHE had shareholders' funds of PS6,994,758 last year.
Rolf Harris Enterprises is owned by RHEL Holdings, which was set up in January 2012. The holding company is in turn owned by Harris and his wife.
Half of RHE is owned by Harris and his wife, while the other half is owned by family trusts. The trusts are likely to be tax efficient structures.
Harris will be sentenced on Friday after he was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault against four girls, the youngest of who was just seven-years-old.
But a number of other women, whose alleged attacks took place overseas, including in Australia, also gave evidence at the trial.
Australian police are now understood to be liaising with Scotland Yard and could bring charges of their own against Harris.
