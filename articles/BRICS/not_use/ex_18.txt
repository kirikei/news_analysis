The euphoric news of the extended Modi-Xi discussion ("PM calls for UNSC, IMF reform" July 16) and the positive gestures by China towards India especially on the need to work towards a settlement of the border issue have greatly eased tensions. Hopefully, this will also pave the way for greater cross-border trade. However, there is a need to constantly work on diplomatic solutions.

The BRICS summit and the news that the BRICS bank will have an Indian head bring new hope to India. It will also help reduce the dominating influence of the West in the global financial markets. Almost half the world's population is spread across the BRICS region. If India and China are able to work in tandem, it will help development in this part of the world. It might even help put pressure on the U.N., which seems to be largely controlled by the needs of the U.S.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to have scored diplomatic points in Brazil. The developments relating to the new BRICS bank and the meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping will mark the beginning of a new chapter for Indian politics at the international level.
