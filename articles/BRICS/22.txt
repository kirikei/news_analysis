The halls of Fortaleza's conference centre were full of whispers about whether or not these Brics nations - which often see each other more as rivals than friends - could agree a deal on the development bank.
But challenges were overcome and the announcements were made. Despite their political and economic differences, the one thing these countries do agree upon is that rich countries have too much power in institutions like the World Bank and the IMF.
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's comments made that feeling crystal clear - the Brics countries, she said, have the power to introduce positive changes - ones that they think are more equal and fair.
At first, the bank will start off with $50bn in initial capital.
The emergency reserve fund - which was announced as a "Contingency Reserve Arrangement" - will also have $100bn, and will help developing nations avoid "short-term liquidity pressures, promote further Brics cooperation, strengthen the global financial safety net and complement existing international arrangements".
The creation of the Brics bank will almost surely create competition for both the World Bank and other similar regional funds.
Brics nations have criticised the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for not giving developing nations enough voting rights.
One of the goals for the bank - whose creation has been discussed for some time - would be to increase the amount of money loaned to developing countries to help with infrastructure projects.
