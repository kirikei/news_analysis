Sandusky's wife: Prosecution report isn't truthful

Posted: 			Monday, June 23, 2014, 12:10 PM HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Jerry Sandusky's wife says Pennsylvania's top prosecutor lacks the courage to admit the former Penn State assistant coach isn't guilty of the child molestation charges that sent him to prison.
Dottie Sandusky issued a statement Monday after Attorney General Kathleen Kane released a report into how the case was handled by police and prosecutors and why it took nearly three years to file charges.
Dottie Sandusky says the charges were delayed because there was no legitimate evidence against him.
The report questions why their home wasn't searched until 2011 even though authorities fielded a complaint against Sandusky in late 2008.
Dottie Sandusky says if they'd searched earlier they'd have found nothing. The report says the search produced victims' photos and a highlighted list of participants from his children's charity.
