Key findings from the report issued Monday by Geoff Moulton, a special deputy attorney general, into how police and prosecutors handled the child molestation investigation of Jerry Sandusky:
* About the role of Tom Corbett as attorney general, running for governor during the investigation in 2010: Moulton found "no direct evidence that electoral politics influenced any important decision made in the Sandusky investigation."
* "It does not appear that Attorney General Corbett took affirmative steps to slow the pace of the investigation."
* Were there adequate resources devoted to the investigation? "While it is true that the pace and scope of the investigation increased considerably in 2011, the discovery of most victims and incidents identified in 2011 cannot be easily linked to the infusion of additional resources."
* Investigative steps taken "relatively late in the game" were "contacting The Second Mile for lists of participants, contacting Centre County (Children and Youth Services) to ask about prior allegations, using Sandusky's autobiography to identify potential victims, and searching Sandusky's home."
* The use of the grand jury to investigate does not appear to have slowed the investigation.
* A draft grand jury report was circulated in early 2010, and the prosecutor who wrote it repeatedly asked her higher-ups about it until that August, when she was told the case would not go forward based on current evidence and was directed to find additional victims.
* The case picked up steam after November 2011, when a tip to the Centre County district attorney directed investigators to Mike McQueary, then an assistant coach for Penn State's football team.
