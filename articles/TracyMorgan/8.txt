Tracy Morgan Pictured In A Wheelchair - www.channelstv.com
5 weeks after Former Saturday Night Live star, Tracy Morgan, was hit from behind by a Wal-Mart truck on the New Jersey Turnpike, he heads out in a wheelchair and was spotted for the first time since the accident that left a fellow comedian dead.
Tracy, who was moved to rehabilitation after being hospitalized, broke his femur in the accident and plans to continue rehabbing his broken leg and rib injury at home with an aggressive outpatient program.
The comedian is suing Wal-Mart for negligence, as one of their drivers was involved in auto accident on June 7, saying that they should have known that its driver had been awake for over 24 hours and that his commute of 700 miles from his home in Georgia to work in Delaware was 'unreasonable.'
The suit also alleges the driver fell asleep at the wheel, causing the crash.
His friend, James McNair was killed in the crash, while Comedian Ardie Fuqua, of Jersey City, remains in critical condition.
