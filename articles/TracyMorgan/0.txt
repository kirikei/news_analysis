Tracy Morgan is "doing good" and "resting", according to his son.
The 45-year-old 30 Rock star was involved in a six-car accident that took the life of comic James McNair last month.
Tracy sustained several injuries, including a broken leg, femur, nose and busted ribs.
As the first images of the comedian taken since the collision were published Sunday, his son, Tracy Jr., said the outlook for his father-s recovery is bright.
"He-s doing good. He-s just resting," he told the New York Daily News outside of the family-s New Jersey home.
TMZ meanwhile published photos of Tracy with his leg bandaged and sitting in a wheelchair while out.
The website reports the star is undergoing aggressive rehabilitation therapy.
Tracy was riding in a limousine in his home state when his vehicle collided with a tractor trailer on a turnpike during the early hours of June 7.
At the time of the tragedy he was travelling with four others in the back of the automobile.
Two other passengers in the front of the vehicle were unhurt.
Last Thursday, Tracy filed suit against Walmart, claiming the retailer was negligent because its driver, Kevin Roper, hadn-t slept in 24 hours prior to the crash.
That driver pleaded not guilty to charges of vehicular homicide and assault by auto. He denies having fallen asleep at the wheel.
The case continues.
