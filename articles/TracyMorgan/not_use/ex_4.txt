Tracy Morgan recovering at Cresskill home: 'I'm OK, I feel strong' | NJ.com
CRESSKILL - Comedian Tracy Morgan flashed a victory symbol and spoke briefly in public Monday for the first time since a deadly crash on the NJ Turnpike killed his friend and left him seriously injured.
Morgan told news photographers gathered outside his Cresskill home: "Love you, thank you very much. Appreciate it," according to the New York Daily News.
The newspaper reported Morgan seemed upbeat but moved gingerly and leaned on a walker as he climbed into a waiting Lincoln Navigator.
"I'm OK," he said to photographers. "I feel strong."
Morgan returned home after spending weeks at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, followed by rehab.
Last week, Morgan's attorneys sued Wal-Mart.
According to the lawsuit, Wal-Mart should have known the driver that rammed Morgan's limo bus had been awake for over 24 hours, and that his commute of 700 miles from his home in Georgia to work in Delaware was "unreasonable." The suit alleges the driver, Kevin Roper, fell asleep behind the wheel.
