Tracy Morgan: 'I'm OK, I Feel Strong' - The Daily Beast
Noticeably thinner and leaning on a walker, Tracy Morgan appeared in public for the first time since a horrific car crash broke his ribs and leg. Morgan was leaving his New Jersey home on Monday morning when he flashed a V sign and said "I'm OK, I feel strong." A scar was visible on his temple from the crash with a Walmart tractor trailer that killed friend James McNair. "Love you, thank you very much. Appreciate it," he told photographers who applauded him.
