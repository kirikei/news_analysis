Tracy Morgan's Recovery 'Will Be Arduous,' Rep Says
Morgan, 45, was seriously injured last month when a truck hit the vehicle in which he was riding. He suffered a broken femur, a broken nose and several broken ribs, among other injuries. His friend, comedian James McNair, died.
On Saturday, a rep for the comedian told ABC News that he had been released from a rehabilitation center and moved home, where he will continue to recover "with an aggressive outpatient program."
"He asked me to pass along his sincerest gratitude to everyone who has helped him get to this point," his publicist told ABC News. "He would also appreciate some privacy during this crucial point in his recovery."
