Megan Fox's movies, such as "Transformers," can be seen replaying on TV all the time.
But in an effort to keep her kids grounded, the actress told Parents.com she won't let her children watch television.
"I do let them watch movies, I just don't let them watch TV," she said. "With movies I feel like there's a beginning, a middle and an end. It's linear. There's a clear story. I think that it's different than just putting a kid in front of the television, because it's just nonstop. They're just being bombarded with all of this sort of live media and it's very overwhelming and it's too stimulating I think for anyone."
