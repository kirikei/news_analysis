Second seed Li Na and former world number one Victoria Azarenka are through to the second round of Wimbledon, but US 18th seed Sloane Stephens has fallen at the first hurdle.
Li, a three-time quarter-finalist at Wimbledon, got back on track after her French Open misery thanks to a 7-5, 6-2 win over Polish qualifier Paula Kania.
She suffered her worst grand slam performance since 2011 when she slumped to an opening round exit against Kristina Mladenovic in Paris.
But the 32-year-old from Wuhan was too strong for world number 183 Kania, hitting 24 winners to set up a second round meeting with Austria's Yvonne Meusburger.
"In the beginning I was a bit shaky because I hadn't played her before and she was using my power against me, so I was really happy to win in the end," said Li.
Azarenka won her first match since January as the eighth seed triumphed 6-3, 7-5 against Croatia's Mirjana Lucic-Baroni, who was a semi-finalist back in 1999.
The former Australian Open champion has been plagued by a left foot injury which kept her off tour from Indian Wells in March to Eastbourne last week where she lost her opener to Camila Giorgi.
But US 18th seed Stephens, a quarter-finalist in 2013, was defeated by Russian former top 10 player Maria Kirilenko, 6-2, 7-6 (8/6).
Kirilenko, who had won just one match all year after a lengthy battle with a knee injury, claimed victory on a sixth match point.
Five-time champion Venus Williams, the 30th seed, beat Spain's world number 53 Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.
Czech sixth seed Petra Kvitova, the 2011 champion, beat compatriot Andrea Hlavackova, 6-3, 6-0.
