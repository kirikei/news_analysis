Nicki Minaj Addresses Rumors of Iggy Azalea Shade | Billboard
Nicki Minaj gave one hell of an acceptance speech at the 2014 BET Awards on Sunday (June 30). She won the award for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist.
Everyone amusingly tuned in as she kicked off her speech with: "What I want the world to know about Nicki Minaj is when you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it." (The best part though is when she followed up with "No, no shade. No, no no shade" and this sassy half turn below...)
The internet was quick to assume that she was referring to Iggy Azalea when touching on ghostwriting. (There's been rumors that Azalea uses ghostwriters to assist with her rhymes.)
Nicki Minaj took to Twitter today to clarify the "no shade" and speak on female artists.
The media puts words in my mouth all the time and this is no different. I will always take a stance on women writing b/c I believe in us!

I believe we're smart enough to write down our own thoughts and perspective, just like the men do. I've been saying this for 5 YEARS

I fell in love with Lauryn Hill b/c I knew she was the author behind those amazingly profound and articulated songs on the MisEducation

It's the same reason I have a different level of respect for Missy. I know she's a writer and a producer. Women MUST aspire for more.

I've congratulated Iggy on the success of Fancy, publicly. She should be very proud of that. All the women nominated should b proud.

That will never change my desire to motivate women to write. Our voices have to be heard. I hope I inspire up & coming females to do that.

Just last year rapper, Ransom, claimed to have ghostwritten for Nicki Minaj. She shut down that rumor real quick when TMZ asked her about it: "I'm undisputed because I'm the only female rapper that [since] day one, I don't need no motherfuckin' ghostwriter."
