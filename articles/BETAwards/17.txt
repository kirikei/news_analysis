Iggy Azalea Is Over The 'Explosion Of Pettiness' After BET Awards - MTV
by Nadeska Alexis 7 mins ago
Sigh. Both Iggy Azalea and Nicki Minaj are tired of the faux animosity that everyone else is trying to drum up between them. That's clear because both rappers have addressed that in some way, on social media today.
First, Nicki took to Twitter to explain that her BET Awards speech was not intended to throw shade at Iggy Azalea -- or any other female artist, for that matter -- and then Iggy hit Instagram with a message of her own, just hours later. There was plenty of chatter when she didn't take home the award for Best Female Hip Hop artist, but she's clearly not losing any sleep over it.
Hopefully this is the last time that either of them will have to addresses this non-issue. And, FYI, if Nicki was throwing shade at anyone in that speech when she talked about writing her own lyrics, it was probably this guy.
