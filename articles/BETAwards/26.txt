Chris Brown reportedly blames booze hiatus for wobbly club exit - Los Angeles Times
Chris Brown, lightweight? Interesting what some time behind bars can do to a guy ...
A rather, ahem, loose-looking Brown was seen, in video posted by TMZ, being assisted from club door to car door by two friends as he left Hollywood's Playhouse nightclub in the early morning hours Monday.
The singer had been at an after-party following Sunday's BET Awards at L.A. Live, where he'd taken the stage with Lil Wayne, Tyga and Travis Barker.
Thing is: Breezy, who appeared to have had a good time at Playhouse in pictures posted by TheYBF, just got out of jail on June 2. He'd spent almost four months behind bars after a stretch in a couple of rehab facilities. Bottle service hasn't exactly been abundant.
Now he's "privately" saying that after six months without a drink, he can't pound like he used to, according to TMZ. But that didn't stop Weezy, Tyga and Soulja Boy from plying him with liquor to celebrate his return to the stage.
"Several" shots were consumed, the website said.
No need to worry about another probation violation in the Rihanna-assault case: Brown's newest sentence only requires him to stay off marijuana, not alcohol. Also no need to worry that Breezy got behind the wheel: Girlfriend Karrueche Tran apparently had the keys to the orange Lamborghini they slipped away in.
"Thank you God for allowing me to do what I love and blessing me with an amazing support team," he said Monday on Twitter.
The look on Brown's face as he was leaving Playhouse earlier in the day might suggest that getting hammered isn't high on his "love" list these days.
