NOT QUITE: Lionel Richie on stage at the BET Awards, featuring his misspelled name.
You'd have thought someone would've checked, before airing to almost eight million viewers, the spelling of BET Award winners' names.
Lionel Richie was honoured on Sunday night with the Lifetime Achievement Award. Artists such as John Legend, Pharrell Williams, and Yolanda Adams took part in the ceremony, performing his songs and presenting the trophy to the soul singer-songwriter.
Despite this, BET still managed to misspell his name on national television, the Huffington Post reports.
Upon announcement of the award, a caption reading: "Lionel Ritchie" appeared on screen.
The mistake soon started trending on Twitter -- with most tweeters not realising the error, and others expressing outrage.
However, the blunder was forgotten when Richie took to the stage.
"Soul is a feeling. Not a colour," he said. "Talent is a God-given gift, and not a category. Out of the box is that magical place where talent -- pure talent goes -- to live and thrive and breathe. And may you never give that up as long as you're in this business."
Neither Richie nor BET commented on the error.
