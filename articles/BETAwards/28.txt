NICKI Minaj says she nearly died last week, but was too afraid to call an ambulance because she feared the recording would end up on gossip sites such as TMZ.
Minaj made the shocking revelation during her acceptance speech at the BET Awards yesterday after winning Best Female Hip-Hop artist for the fifth consecutive year.

"The other day, literally I didn't tell anyone this, I really thought I was about to die," she said while on stage. "Like I was saying my prayers to die. And I didn't even wanna call the ambulance because I thought, 'Well if I call the ambulance, it's gonna be on TMZ.' And I would rather sit there and die ... and it made me realise, I don't care what anybody gotta say. I'ma do me, I'ma do me. And I hope and pray that BET continues to honour authenticity. And that's all I'm gonna say about that."

Gossip websites such as TMZ have often gotten hold of leaked 911 calls and run them on their site.
Meanwhile, Minaj's reference to "authenticity" appeared to be a thinly veiled jibe at her Aussie rapper Iggy Azalea, who didn't write her own mega-hit, Fancy.
"I'm still one of the only emcees that's out here spitting metaphors and making you think," she said, "and I really don't even care if I get my credit or if I don't."

"But my point is, what I want the world to know about Nicki Minaj is, that when you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it."
The rapper has yet to elaborate on her brush with death.
