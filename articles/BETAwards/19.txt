Minaj: I didn't diss Azalea - TV3 Xpose Entertainment
Nicki Minaj blames the media for twisting her words.
Nicki Minaj did not throw shade at Iggy Azalea.
It's been reported that the Pills n Potions singer was referring to the Australian performer during her acceptance speech at the BET Awards over the weekend. But now the 31-year-old has taken to her Twitter account to clear up the speculation.
"The media puts words in my mouth all the time and this is no different. I will always take a stance on women writing b/c I believe in us! (sic)" she wrote.
Nicki picked up the Best Female Hip-Hop Artist accolade at the ceremony on Sunday. As she accepted the award, the emcee said: "What I want the world to know about Nicki Minaj is when you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it."
Though she didn't state who she was directing her comments at, the media has guessed that they were about the 24-year-old, who was also nominated in that category. It has been alleged in a number of publications previously that the Fancy singer has used ghost writers throughout her career.
"I believe we're smart enough to write down our own thoughts and perspective, just like the men do. I've been saying this for 5 YEARS," Nicki continued on the social networking site. "I've congratulated Iggy on the success of Fancy, publicly. She should be very proud of that. All the women nominated should b proud. That will never change my desire to motivate women to write. Our voices have to be heard. I hope I inspire up & coming females to do that (sic)."
