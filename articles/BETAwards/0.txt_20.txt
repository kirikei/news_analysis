Nicki Minaj told the crowd at the BET Awards that she was close to death recently -- an experience that has helped her be herself.
The rapper rambled onstage when accepting her fifth consecutive win for best female hip-hop artist, where she thanked Lil Wayne for his support, talked about writing her own lyrics and about getting the credit she deserves in the industry.
"The other day, literally I didn't tell anybody this, I really thought I was about to die. Like, I was saying my prayers to die. And I didn't even want to call the ambulance because I thought, 'Well if I call the ambulance, it's going to be on TMZ,'" she said, as some of the audience laughed.
"And I would rather sit there and die," she added, looking to the crowd. "And it made me realise I don't care what anybody got to say. I'm going to do me."
The multitalented Pharrell, who also won best male R&B/pop artist, kicked off the show with a playful performance of Come Get It Bae featuring the reclusive Missy Elliott. Host Chris Rock also succeeded with back-to-back jokes about Donald Sterling, the hit series Scandal and rapper Rick Ross, who he mentioned multiple times. He passed out food from Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles, playing off of Ellen DeGeneres pizza party at the Academy Awards.
It helped take attention away from a fatal shooting and a separate stabbing at unsanctioned parties celebrating the ceremony. One person was killed and five injured in separate incidents ahead of the show, Los Angeles police said. The events were "unauthorised and unaffiliated with the BET Awards," BET said in a statement.
A tribute to '90s R&B was met with praise: Groups like Silk, Color Me Badd and Troop performed well-known jams that enticed the crowd. Drake, Beyonce and Jay Z were top nominees with five each. Drake, who was originally set to perform, did not attend. He won best male hip-hop artist.
Lupita Nyong'o, who won an Oscar for 12 Years a Slave, was named best actress.

Nicki Minaj Addresses Rumors of Iggy Azalea Shade | Billboard
Nicki Minaj gave one hell of an acceptance speech at the 2014 BET Awards on Sunday (June 30). She won the award for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist.
Everyone amusingly tuned in as she kicked off her speech with: "What I want the world to know about Nicki Minaj is when you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it." (The best part though is when she followed up with "No, no shade. No, no no shade" and this sassy half turn below...)
The internet was quick to assume that she was referring to Iggy Azalea when touching on ghostwriting. (There's been rumors that Azalea uses ghostwriters to assist with her rhymes.)
Nicki Minaj took to Twitter today to clarify the "no shade" and speak on female artists.
The media puts words in my mouth all the time and this is no different. I will always take a stance on women writing b/c I believe in us!

I believe we're smart enough to write down our own thoughts and perspective, just like the men do. I've been saying this for 5 YEARS

I fell in love with Lauryn Hill b/c I knew she was the author behind those amazingly profound and articulated songs on the MisEducation

It's the same reason I have a different level of respect for Missy. I know she's a writer and a producer. Women MUST aspire for more.

I've congratulated Iggy on the success of Fancy, publicly. She should be very proud of that. All the women nominated should b proud.
-- PillsNPotions (@NICKIMINAJ) July 2, 2014
That will never change my desire to motivate women to write. Our voices have to be heard. I hope I inspire up & coming females to do that.

Just last year rapper, Ransom, claimed to have ghostwritten for Nicki Minaj. She shut down that rumor real quick when TMZ asked her about it: "I'm undisputed because I'm the only female rapper that [since] day one, I don't need no motherfuckin' ghostwriter."
