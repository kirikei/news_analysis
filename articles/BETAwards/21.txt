Don't twist Nicki Minaj's words...
The "Pills n Potions" rapper took to Twitter this morning to speak her mind regarding the recent allegations that she dissed Iggy Azalea in her BET Awards acceptance speech on Sunday.
Minaj, who won for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist, didn't mention the "Fancy" singer when she took the stage, but certainly threw shade on females in the business who don't write their own material.
"The media puts words in my mouth all the time and this is no different," she told fans. "I will always take a stance on women writing b/c I believe in us! I believe we're smart enough to write down our own thoughts and perspective, just like the men do. I've been saying this for 5 YEARS."

The 31-year-old musician added, "I've congratulated Iggy on the success of Fancy, publicly. She should be very proud of that. All the women nominated should b proud. That will never change my desire to motivate women to write. Our voices have to be heard. I hope I inspire up & coming females to do that."
So what did Minaj say at the awards show that got everyone's feathers ruffled?
"I thank God that I've been placed in a position to do something and represent women in a culture that is so male-driven," the outspoken star told the audience.
"What I want the world to know about Nicki Minaj is, that when you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it."
