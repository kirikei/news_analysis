Did rapper Nicki Minaj publicly diss Iggy Azalea?
That's the question being asked after Minaj's rambling Best Female Hip Hop Artist acceptance speech at the BET Awards.
In her address, Minaj stressed she writes all her own lyrics - an apparent jibe at Azalea, who is rumoured to employ ghost writers for her rap tracks.
"When you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it," she said.
When the crowd cheered in response, she insisted she meant "no shade" by the remark.
But the BET Awards should continue to "honour authenticity", the Starships singer added.
When Azalea took to the stage to perform, Minaj also appeared to mock the Australian performer by pouting and posing as a camera panned the crowd.
While Minaj might not be a fan, Azalea did win an unlikely ally from her BET performance.
"Love it! @IggyAzalea #Killingit on stage at The #BET Awards," Paris Hilton tweeted.
