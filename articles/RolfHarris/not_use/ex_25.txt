Perth Rolf Harris monument to get the chop
The City of Perth says it will likely tear up a CBD footpath plaque commemorating Rolf Harris.
The 84-year-old was on Monday found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls - one of whom was as young as seven or eight - in the UK between 1968 and 1986.
And now his home town is deciding what to do with monuments honouring the disgraced entertainer.
'The Boy from Bassendean' is among more than 150 notable West Australians celebrated with a plaque inlaid in the footpath of Perth's St Georges Terrace.
City of Perth Mayor Lisa Scaffidi said the council was considering tearing it up.
'What we've looked at this morning already is a council consideration in the next few weeks. We'll consider the removal, most likely, of the plaque,' Ms Scaffidi told Fairfax radio on Tuesday.
The council would first ask for the views of committee that selected Harris for a plaque, she said.
'I can't say until the council decision is made but the general feeling around the place is that we don't accept those kind of offences,' Ms Scaffidi said.
'It's a very sad issue and something we need to deal with.'
It is also understood the Town of Bassendean plans to consider at a special meeting on Thursday whether to remove Harris's status as a freeman of the town.
It emerged in May that a portrait of Harris had been removed from Bassendean's council chambers.
There's also the question of what to do with his art, which adorns the halls of Perth Modern School, where he was a student.
Harris is likely to be jailed at his sentencing on Friday.
