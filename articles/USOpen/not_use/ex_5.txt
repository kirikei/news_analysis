Sorry Martin: Kaymer's historic US Open victory largely ignored at home
BERLIN - Martin Kaymer's historic victory at the U.S. Open has been largely met by indifference in his homeland.
Kaymer became the first champion from Germany with an eight-shot victory on Sunday, but his success barely caused a ripple at home, where attention is firmly focused on football.
Germany opens its World Cup campaign against Portugal on Monday, meaning Kaymer's triumph could not have come at a worse time for attention. Chancellor Angela Merkel is in Brazil.
The congratulations he did receive even had a football-flavour.
Germany and former Cologne forward Lukas Podolski was one of the few to recognize Kaymer's "legendary performance" in a tweet.
Thankfully, the World Cup is only once every four years. Kaymer, a Cologne fan, will just have to do it again as defending champion.
