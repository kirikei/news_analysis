Krauthammer on Hobby Lobby Ruling: 'When State Expands, It Impinges on Religious Practice' - Fox Nation
FOX News Insider:
Charles Krauthammer this evening discussed the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby ruling.
"When the state expands, even if it's doing stuff unintentionally, has no intention of impinging on religious practice, it will, inevitably especially if you're gonna control a sixth of the economy and the most intimate interaction a citizen has, which is health care," Krauthammer said.
Krauthammer said the decision is in "no way gonna prevent access to contraception," but is a way of protecting religious practice.
