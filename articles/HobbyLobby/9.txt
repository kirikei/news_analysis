Religious groups want to opt out of LGBT hiring order | Early & Often
Just a day after the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby ruling, religious leaders formally asked to be exempt from an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against the LGBT community. The White House announced the order last week.
The Atlantic reports the letter was sent to President Barack Obama by 14 representatives on Tuesday.
"Without a robust religious exemption, this expansion of hiring rights will come at an unreasonable cost to the common good, national unity and religious freedom," they wrote.
One of the main points was to note the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which was passed by the Senate but hasn't been brought up in the House, has a religious exemption.
Our concern about an executive order without a religious exemption is about more than the direct financial impact on religious organizations. While the nation has undergone incredible social and legal change over the last decade, we still live in a nation with different beliefs about sexuality. We must find a way to respect diversity of opinion on this issue in a way that respects the dignity of all parties to the best of our ability. There is no perfect solution that will make all parties completely happy.
While the letter didn't directly address Hobby Lobby, Michael Wear, one of signees, told The Atlantic such concerns need to be addressed by the administration.
"The administration does have a decision to make whether they want to recalibrate their approach to some of these issues," he said.
