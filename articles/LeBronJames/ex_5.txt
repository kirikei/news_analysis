SANDUSKY, Ohio -- NBA superstar LeBron James has one more offer to consider in deciding where to play next season: Ohio's Cedar Point amusement park is promising to rename one of its roller coasters "King James" if he returns home to play for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
A park spokesman says it's a legitimate offer that originated with the CEO.
Hey @KingJames - come back to the @cavs and we'll rename one of our coasters, "King James!" Ball in your court, sir. RT, #Ohio!

Cedar Point sent out a tweet with the proposal on Wednesday, telling James the ball was in his court. James is a free agent and is in Las Vegas as he nears a decision on his NBA future.
The Sandusky amusement park says James was a frequent visitor during his time growing up in Akron and while playing his first seven seasons for the Cavaliers before he left for Miami.
