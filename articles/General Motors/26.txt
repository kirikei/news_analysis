GM offers at least $1m for each ignition switch death - Newspaper - DAWN.COM
WASHINGTON: General Motors said Monday it will pay at least $1 million in compensation to the families of each person killed in accidents apparently caused by defective ignition switches in its cars.
GM has so far publicly acknowledged 13 deaths linked to the ignition switch defect, but federal safety officials suggest the toll could be higher.
The top US automaker is under investigation for failing to recall the problem cars for more than a decade, even after some in the company were aware of the defect.
GM began recalling 2.6m older model cars only in February. Kenneth Feinberg, the prominent lawyer GM appointed to head the compensation fund, announced Monday that claims will be taken from August 1 through December 31.
"There is no ceiling on the aggregate dollars," he told a press conference.
For each eligible death claim, in addition to the $1m for the victim, $300,000 will be awarded for the surviving spouse and another $300,000 for each of the victim's surviving dependents.
Financial and medical treatment compensation will also be offered for those with eligible physical injury claims from an accident.
People who were killed or injured prior to GM's government-backed bankruptcy reorganization can file claims with the "new" GM.
