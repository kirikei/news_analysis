Turkey to normalise ties with Israel after Gaza strikes end
Ankara: Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that it is impossible for his country to restore the strained bilateral ties with Israel unless the strikes on Gaza end, a media report said.
Earlier in the day, Erdogan made phone calls to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal as Israeli military continued with its offensive against Gaza targets, Xinua reported.
He told the two that Turkey will stand in unity with the Palestinians against Israeli attacks, media reported.
Erdogan also urged the international community to take actions to stop Israeli attacks, and provide humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians, according to the report.
Since Israeli campaign against Hamas began late Monday night, at least 88 Palestinians were killed and 660 injured, as well as more than 70 houses and around 15 governmental constructions in Gaza were destroyed, Hamas officials said.
