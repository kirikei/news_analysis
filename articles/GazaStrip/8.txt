Hamas rejects Egypt proposal for truce with Israel - Businessweek
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- A senior Hamas official says the Palestinian militant group rejects an Egyptian proposal for a cease-fire with Israel.
The official, Sami Abu Zuhri, spoke moments after Israel accepted the offer on Tuesday.
Abu Zuhri told The Associated Press that "this proposal is not acceptable."
The Egyptian plan calls for hostilities to end Tuesday morning, followed by negotiations on easing the border blockade of Gaza.
The territory has been under a blockade by Egypt and Israel since Hamas seized Gaza in 2007.
