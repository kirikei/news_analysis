British Open at a glance - Sport - NZ Herald News
A brief look at the third round at the British Open on Saturday:
LEADING: Rory McIlroy shot a 4-under 68 and is at 16-under 200 overall.
TRAILING: Rickie Fowler is six strokes behind, with Sergio Garcia another shot back.
BIG ADVANTAGE: McIlroy has the largest 54-hole edge at the British Open since Tiger Woods also led by six at St. Andrews in 2000.
GOOD ODDS: No player has ever blown a six-shot lead on the final day at golf's oldest major championship.
SHOT OF THE DAY: McIlroy's 5-iron from 239 yards rolled up 10 feet from the cup at No. 18, setting up his second eagle.
WHERE'S TIGER: Nowhere close to the lead. Woods had a double bogey and a triple bogey on the way to a 73 that left him 19 shots behind McIlroy.
DEFENDING CHAMP: Phil Mickelson didn't get the score he needed in prime conditions for going low. He was 15 shots behind after a 71.
TWO TEES: The R&A's unprecedented decision to start early off two tees looked justified when heavy rain pounded Royal Liverpool less than an hour after the round ended.
NOTEWORTHY: With another round in the 60s, McIlroy would tie or beat the major championship record for the lowest score in relation to par Woods' 19-under score at the 2000 British Open.
QUOTEWORTHY: "I've been in this position before, and I've been able to convert, and I've been able to get the job done." McIlroy, on his comfort at holding a big lead as he goes for his third major title.
