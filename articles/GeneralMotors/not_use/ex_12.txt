Chrysler and General Motors sales went up by 9.2% and 1% respectively, while Ford sales dropped by 5.8%, compared with last June. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:
I'm surprised anyone would buy a GM vehicle. It adds several million to its recall list on what seems like a daily basis.

The first Ford Escapes of the new design had massive recalls, but most consumers like them, and it has been a great seller. Most recalls are not to correct a problem but to prevent one from ever happening. And many are now software-related, too -- and we get those all the time on our computers and phones and think nothing of them.

In June 2013, sales for Ford were pretty good (sales were up 13%). So is it really surprising to see an overall 6% drop from those numbers this year? Not really. And as for the trucks, the manufacturers are approaching downtime, during which they will switch out to manufacturing the new 2015 model.
They are offering less in incentives so they have enough trucks to get them to the new model when factoring in the downtime. Ford knows what it's doing. Plus it managed its finances and did not take any bailout money. I'm Glad to be driving two of its vehicles.
