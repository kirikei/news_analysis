Philippines death toll from Typhoon Rammasun rises to 40 - LA Times
Typhoon Rammasun swept through the Philippines on Wednesday, leaving 40 dead and 17 injured, according to the government disaster management agency.
The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said in a statement early Thursday that storm warnings had been lowered as the typhoon moved away from the country. Two bridges and more than 20 roads were rendered impassable by flooding from the storm, which is known as Glenda in the Philippines.
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration had warned residents to prepare for gale-force winds during the height of the storm.
Many residents in Manila lost power during the storm, but the Manila Electric Co. said it had restored power to 65% of its coverage area by Thursday morning.
The typhoon was moving toward southeastern China and was expected to next make landfall near Hainan island Friday, according to the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
The Hong Kong Observatory also issued a strong wind alert, though the typhoon is not expected to make landfall in Hong Kong.
