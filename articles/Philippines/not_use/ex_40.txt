PHL shares snub Glenda aftermath, heeds regional trend, adds 0.41% at noon break | Economy | GMA News Online
An uptrend in regional markets drove Philippine share prices higher toward the noon break Thursday, outweighing the negative impact of Typhoon Glenda (Rammasun) on investors' sentiment.
The bellwether PSEi added 27.96 points or 0.41 percent to 6,862.00 at the noon close. The All Shares index increased by 13.39 points or 0.33 percent to 4,114.00.
The market is playing catch-up with overseas markets after trading was suspended Wednesday due to severe weather conditions brought about by Typhoon Glenda, Unicapital Securities Inc. research head Lexter Azurin told GMA News Online.
"The Dow Jones climbed over 17,000 while Asian stocks followed suit," he said.
US stocks rose on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at a record high, boosted by the latest merger news and some strong corporate earnings, Reuters reported.
Somehow, investors snubbed the impact of Typhoon Glenda in Luzon, Azurin said. "The regional trend overshadowed the effects of Glenda," he said.
Philippine financial markets were closed Wednesday as Typhoon Glenda shuttered Metro Manila and nearby provinces with strong winds that toppled electrical poles and downed transmission facilities.
