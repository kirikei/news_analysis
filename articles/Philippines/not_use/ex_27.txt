The storm destroyed about 7,000 houses and damaged 19,000, the executive director of the National Disaster Agency, Alexander Pama, said. More than 530,000 people had taken refuge in evacuation centres, according to official figures.
Most schools remained closed in the capital and southern Luzon, the most densely populated part of the country with about 17 million people. Power has been restored to just over half of the Luzon grid.
