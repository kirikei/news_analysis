As Typhoon Glenda (Rammusan) moved away from Luzon, it continued to bring rain to parts of the country Wednesday afternoon.
PAGASA issued a "yellow" heavy rainfall warning over Bataan and Zambales in Central Luzon, and warned the public of possible flooding in the said areas.
"Flooding is still expected in low lying areas," it said.
Under PAGASA's color-coded rainfall advisory system, a yellow warning indicates 7.5 to 15 mm of rain in one hour, along with possible flooding. 	Residents are advised to monitor the weather.
The next rainfall warning is expected at 7 p.m.
Glenda lashed parts of Visayas and Luzon with heavy rain and strong winds, and is now expected to exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility by Thursday morning.
As of 3 p.m., it was estimated at 130 km west of Olongapo City.
