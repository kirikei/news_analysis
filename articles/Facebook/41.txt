We're all Facebook's lab-rats, Opinion Premium News & Headlines - THE BUSINESS TIMES
HOW shocking: Facebook had the temerity to conduct an experiment on its users without telling them and now the results have been published in the Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences. Actually, no one should be surprised. For a week in 2012, the social network's staff scientist Adam Kramer and two collaborators used algorithms to doctor the news feeds of 689,003 English-speaking Facebook users. They reduced the number of posts containing "positive" and "negative" words, tracked their lab rat users' own posts, and found that their mood was influenced by that of the news feed. The term, well-known to psychologists studying real-world communications, is "emotional contagion".
If Mr Kramer's week-long experiment appears outrageous, what Facebook does on a daily basis is monstrous. An algorithm called EdgeRank scores each post on a number of criteria; such as how frequently a News Feed owner interacts with its author and the quality of that interaction (a comment is more valuable than a "like").
The higher-ranked posts go to the top of the feed. That's why a typical user doesn't see everything her friends are posting - just what Facebook decides she'd be interested in seeing, plus paid advertising (which is also supposed to be targeted). You can tweak the settings to make posts appear in their "natural" order, but few people bother to do it, just as hardly anyone ever reads Facebook's data use policy: buried among these 9,000 words, there is a sentence that says research is a legitimate use.
In other words, on Facebook, one can opt out of having a machine decide what content you will find engaging. Twitter, by contrast, allows users to opt in by using the so-called Discover feed. I find the opt-in tactic more honest, but, predictably, it's less effective from a marketing point of view.
