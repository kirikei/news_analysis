NEW DELHI -- Facebook's second-most-powerful executive, Ms Sheryl Sandberg, has apologised for the way in which a controversial psychological experiment conducted on nearly 700,000 of its users was "poorly communicated", although she stopped short of saying sorry for the study itself.
The social networking giant is facing potential investigations by Europe's privacy regulators after it disclosed last week that it deliberately manipulated the content of positive and negative posts to see if emotions were contagious.
The company did not seek explicit permission from the affected people -- roughly one out of every 2,500 Facebook users at the time of the experiment -- and some critics have suggested that the research violated its terms of service with its customers. Facebook has said customers gave blanket permission for research as a condition of using the service.
"This was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products, and that was what it was; it was poorly communicated," Facebook chief operating officer, Ms Sandberg, was quoted as saying on Wednesday while on a trip to New Delhi. "And for that communication we apologise. We never meant to upset you.
"We take privacy and security at Facebook really seriously because that is something that allows people to share opinions and emotions," she added.
Ms Sandberg was in New Delhi to meet entrepreneurs and businesswomen to promote her book Lean In.
She also expressed confidence that the company would weather any regulatory inquiries.
"We are in communication with regulators all over the world and this will be okay," she said.
Several European data protection agencies are examining whether Facebook broke local privacy laws through its experiment.
It has emerged that Facebook first conducted research into the impact of posts on its users' moods for 1,180 days between January 2009 and March 2012.
