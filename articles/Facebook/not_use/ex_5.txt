Focus: Facebook experiment | GulfNews.com
Facebook recently admitted to conducting a psychology experiment on nearly 700,000 users without their consent. The experiment included manipulating news feeds to control which emotional expressions the users were exposed to. Although the results of the experiment weren't alarming nor did it directly affect any of the users, however, it clearly violated privacy laws.
The focus of this week's debate is on the recent Facebook experiment and whether the decision to include 700,000 users without their consent is ever justified.
These are the statements to be debated:
* There is a need for stricter laws to protect people from becoming test subjects.
* You agreed to the terms and conditions, therefore the experiment was justified.
Participants will be required to clearly state whether they are 'for' or 'against' the statement and provide their supporting arguments for the same.
