Gary Player says golf needs `iconic` players like Tiger Woods
Washington: Golf legend Gary Player, who scored one of his most memorable victories at the British Open forty years ago, has said that golf needs `icons` like Tiger Woods.
Player is willing Woods to win the 2014 British Open at Hoylake.
South Africa`s Player, who was the last golfer to lead outright for all four rounds of the oldest major when he won at Royal Lytham and St Anne`s in 1974, said that Woods is definitely the most talented man who ever held a golf club in his hand.
According to CNN, Player believes that golf is the poorer for Woods, who battles back from injury and loss of form, not being at the top of the leaderboard and said that they need this icon.
Player said that Woods improves ratings and brings in more media attention to golf.
The former world number one has been troubled by injury this season and has only played once since March having being sidelined for the Masters and the U.S. Open and missing the cut at Congressional in his comeback event.
The 78-year-old South African also said that back in his home nation a lot of young black players are aspiring to be a champion like Woods.
Player also admitted that Woods has got a challenge on his hand and it would not be a surprise if he never wins another major, but added that if the former world number one does, he could go on to win quite a few more.
