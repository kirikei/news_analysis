Former two-times winner Alberto Contador broke down in tears as he quit the Tour de France yesterday after crashing badly on the tough 10th stage and injuring a knee.
The Spaniard was the second major loss to the 101st edition of the Grand Boucle, following reigning champion Chris Froome, who withdrew injured on Wednesday.
The departure of the two race favourites leaves Italian Vincenzo Nibali as the man to beat.
The Astana team leader won yesterday's mountainous 161km 10th stage from Mulhouse to La Planche des Belles Filles to reclaim the the leader's yellow jersey he lost on Sunday to Tony Gallopin of France.
Contador, who began the day ninth overall, 4min 08sec back, crashed at about the 65km mark on a pass between the Petit Ballon climb and the Col du Platzerwasel, with just under 100km still to ride.
The 31-year-old suffered a nasty gash to his right knee and had blood pouring down his leg as he received lengthy treatment at the side of the road.
His knee was patched up by the race doctor and he changed bikes and a shoe before continuing the race.
He had lost about four minutes on the peloton by this time, after which Astana took over pace-setting at the front.
Despite five of Contador's Tinkoff-Saxo team-mates dropping back to help pace him up the Col du Platzerwasel he started to lose more time.
About 15km later and about halfway through the stage, Contador shared a hug with chief lieutenant Australian Michael Rogers before stopping at the side of the road and climbing into a team car.
Visibly in pain, he was in floods of tears.
