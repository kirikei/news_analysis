NEW YORK --
Derek Jeter's final All-Star appearance has helped boost television ratings for the game.
The American League's 5-3 win Tuesday in Minneapolis averaged more than 11.3 million viewers on FOX, up from 11 million for last year's game at the Mets' Citi Field in New York. The rating was up 9 percent for the first full half-hour, when the retiring Yankees shortstop first stepped to the plate.
The network said Wednesday that the 7.0 fast national rating was the highest since 2010. The 2012 edition set a record low with a 6.8.
Ratings represent the percentage of homes with televisions tuned to a program.
