BBC News - Justin Welby: Women bishops vote 'based on theology'
A vote by the Church of England to allow women to become bishops was based on theology, rather than culture, the Archbishop of Canterbury says.
Justin Welby said he was "delighted" with the decision but that he acknowledged that some would struggle with it, stressing that it was important for the church to "hold people together".
But speaking to BBC Newsnight, he refused to be drawn on whether the same reasoning could be used to allow homosexual bishops to drop the current celibacy requirement.
