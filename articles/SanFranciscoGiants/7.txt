POSTGAME NOTES: The Giants lost another home game. - Giants Extra
i mean, you saw it.
-- In the game story, a look at slumps up and down the lineup. It's jarring when you see a team get shut out four times in eight games, or score seven runs in a four-game series. And then you start going through the game logs and see 2 for 25, 1 for 22, .207 average, .162 average, etc. etc. If you're a masochist, it's all in there. At least click on it and look at the color photos, I guess.
-- Dropping 15 of 19 at home is stunning. Will be curious to see if the sellout streak makes it through a weekend series with the Diamondbacks ...
-- Brandon Belt is the 2 for 25, and now you can see why the Giants waited as long as they did when he was crushing prospects during his rehab assignment. It's hard to have your timing down against Major League pitchers, and Belt is still searching.
"People are in midseason form, and the reality is that I'm not," said Belt, who missed eight weeks. "But what gives me confidence is just knowing I've been through struggles before and I know I'll come out of it. I know where I stand as a hitter. It's just a matter of getting that timing back."
The good news, Belt said, is that his thumb feels fine and his legs are under him. He thinks he has the right approach, too. It's about timing, and Belt has shown in the past that with him it can return pretty quickly.
-- Tim Hudson's last five starts: 0-4, 6.07 ERA. The A's knocked him out in the sixth today.
"He was a little off today," manager Bruce Bochy said. "He's done such a great job but today he wasn't quite as sharp and didn't have the same action on his changeup or sinker."
Bochy had a decision to make in the bottom of the fifth, with two in scoring position and two outs in a two-run game. He stuck with Hudson.
"There are two outs there and he had a good (10-pitch walk) the first time," Bochy said. "He hit one of the hardest balls we hit all day. He's earned that. I don't like to take these starters out in a tight ballgame like that."
Left unsaid: Even if a pinch-hitter does go up there and tie the game, the Giants are still in a tight spot. The bullpen has been really inconsistent in recent weeks and probably wasn't keeping the A's at two runs.
-- So, the A's brought their All-Star catcher (Derek Norris) in to pinch-hit for today's starting catcher (John Jaso), and Javier Lopez managed to get the right-hander to fly out to right. So then their third catcher, the .367-hitting Stephen Vogt, breaks the game open with a two-run single. The freaking A's, man. What a roster.
As Carl Steward pointed out, their fourth catcher is the starting third baseman in the All-Star Game.
-- There are always players who stand out more in person, and after these four games, Josh Donaldson and Coco Crisp go on that list. Donaldson hit a Morse-ish homer to right. Not bad for a guy who plays Gold Glove defense at third.
-- Brandon Phillips and Yadier Molina are having thumb surgery and CJ Wilson hit the disabled list this morning. Aaaaand that's why it's never a good idea to blame injuries for one team's swoon. Everyone gets hit hard. The teams that deal with it end up playing in October.
Speaking of Molina, he's out of the All-Star Game, and you figure Buster Posey is the first on deck to replace him. That selection would be a bit of an odd moment for the Giants; I know a few in the organization were privately fine with Posey getting four days off next week.
Posey was fine after that foul tip, by the way. And Scott Kazmir was fine after feeling a leg twinge when time was called as he went into his windup. Angel Hernandez, man ... never fails.
