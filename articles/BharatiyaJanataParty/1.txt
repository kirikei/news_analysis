AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Chief Minister Anandi Patel congratulated BJP leader Amit Shah on being elected as the new BJP president today.
In her message, Patel praised Shah for rising from a humble party worker during 80s to reach at such a high position in the party by displaying strong organisational skills.
"Amitbhai Shah started his political career with ABVP in 1983 and joined BJP in 1986. He held posts of ward secretary of BJP Yuva Morcha and taluka secretary during his initial days. With his skills and organisational abilities, he became national secretary of BJP," Patel said in a statement here.
The Minister also thanked Shah for leading BJP to a thumping victory in Uttar Pradesh in recent Lok Sabha polls.
"As the in-charge of UP (in 2014 General election), Shah gave unprecedented victory to BJP. Now, as the national president, I am confident that he will bring victory for BJP in other states too," she said.
BJP members in the house welcomed the appointment in the assembly, while party leaders and workers also celebrated Shah's appointment at state party office, Gandhinagar.
