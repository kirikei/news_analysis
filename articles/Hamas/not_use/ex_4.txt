Abbas' forces looking for missing Israeli teens - The Hindu
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says his forces are searching for the three Israeli teens missing in the West Bank and criticized their abductors.
Mr. Abbas told Muslim and Arab leaders gathered in Saudi Arabia that those who abducted the three "want to destroy us." He did not elaborate, but appeared to be referring to his government.
Mr. Abbas says that once the kidnappers are found, his government will "settle accounts with them."
The teens disappeared last week and Israel has blamed the Islamic militant Hamas for their apparent abduction. Israel has carried out mass arrests of Hamas activists in response.
Mr. Abbas spoke on Wednesday to a gathering of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Hs remarks were carried by the Palestinian news agency WAFA.
