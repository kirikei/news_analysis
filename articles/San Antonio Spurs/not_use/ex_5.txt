The San Antonio Spurs celebrated their NBA championship with a parade and rally and, to no one's great surprise, Coach Gregg Popovich stole the show.
Pop, known for his less-than-loquacious sideline interviews, suppressed his surly side and unleashed the inner Shecky that everyone has suspected he's been hiding, by counting the Spurs' NBA championships in a rather interesting way. Just watch and see if you're not reminded of a certain LeBron James "not one, not two..." moment.
It was an unusual, for Popovich, moment, but one that anybody who wins five rings gets to savor.
The San Antonio Spurs held a floating parade on the San Antonio River to celebrate their fifth NBA title. An estimated 100,000 people crowded onto the River Walk.
