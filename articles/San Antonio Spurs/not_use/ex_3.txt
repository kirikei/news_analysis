San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich gets an A+ for winning a fifth NBA Championship, but his attire could use a little work.
The NBA's Coach of the Year got a C- fashion grade in Women's Wear Daily despite being named its Man of the Week.
LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, and dozens of other players in the league like to show off their own style.
The fashion magazine doesn't approve of Popovich's look, calling his khaki suit "a human safari tent."
He likely doesn't care what anyone has to say about his style. Popovich will be happily sporting a 2014 NBA Championship t-shirt the rest of the summer.
