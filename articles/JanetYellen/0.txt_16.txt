Dollar rises broadly
July 18, 2014
RECORDER REPORT
The dollar rose broadly on Wednesday amid market speculation Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is tilting toward tightening monetary policies that have kept US interest rates at record lows. "We are seeing the dollar strong against the euro, against sterling, against the yen a little bit," said Thierry Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group Limited in New York.
Disappointing economic reports in Europe and comments on Tuesday and Wednesday by Yellen before Congress suggesting US rate hikes may come sooner than expected were driving dollar purchases, currency strategists said. "It seems to me that there are a few more hawkish hints than we have seen lately," Wizman said. "I don't think we will get more hawkish hints from the Fed until September. But the trend until then, and through that period, is strongly US dollar."
The dollar index, which measures the dollar's performance against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.2 percent to 80.565 after touching its highest level in a month. "She cracked the door open to potentially earlier US rate rises, and that has really caught the market's attention," said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
Treasury yields, seen as central to the dollar's appeal in currency markets, were initially higher on Wednesday but later slipped, with the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note up 3/32 in price to yield 2.537 percent after touching a high of 2.57 percent. Sterling fell against the dollar to $1.7135, off a nearly six-year high of $1.7192 struck on Tuesday, but it was up against the euro to a near two-year peak. The euro was down 0.35 percent at $1.3523, falling to its lowest in one month, while the greenback was slightly higher against the yen at 101.71 yen after touching a one-week high of 101.79.

Government bonds rallied around the world, with a gauge of the debt climbing to a 14-month high, as the shooting down of a Malaysia Airlines plane in Ukraine drove demand for the safest assets.
An index of sovereign debt rose to the highest level since May 2013 yesterday, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. The securities have returned 4.3 percent this year, recouping a loss from 2013. The aircraft was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Demand for safer assets was also boosted as Israel sent soldiers and tanks into Gaza.
"There's geopolitical risk in Ukraine and the Middle East," said Kim Youngsung, the head of overseas investment in Seoul at South Korea's Government Employees Pension Service. "People think the stock market won't be a safe place to invest. They turned to bonds." The agency invests the equivalent of $3.9 billion.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield was little changed at 2.46 percent at 11:21 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.5 percent note due in May 2024 was 100 10/32. The yield dropped as much as nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, yesterday to 2.44 percent, the lowest since May 29.
Treasury 10-year futures contracts rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 125 17/32.
Australia's 10-year yield slid by as much as nine basis points to 3.32 percent, and Japan's 10-year yield fell as far as 0.51 percent. Both figures are the lowest in more than a year.
Ukraine Crisis
The Boeing Co. 777 crashed en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam in the main battleground of Ukraine's civil war, threatening to escalate tensions in Europe's worst geopolitical crisis since the end of the Cold War.
In the Middle East, Israel sent forces into Gaza in a ground offensive aimed at stopping the barrage of missiles fired by Hamas and other Palestinian militants following the collapse of a cease-fire agreement.
The difference between U.S. five- and 30-year yields shrank to the narrowest since 2009 after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers this week that monetary stimulus is still needed, while increases in interest rates may occur sooner if the economy accelerates.
The spread shrank to 163 basis points yesterday, the least since February 2009.
