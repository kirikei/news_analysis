(CNN) -- Six suspected militants were killed in a drone strike in Miranshah Tehsil in North Waziristan, Pakistan, local tribesmen and Pakistani intelligence sources not authorized to speak to media told CNN on Wednesday.
The drone struck a house and a pickup truck in the Daraga Mandi area of Miranshah, they said.
CNN was unable to independently authenticate their accounts. But if true, it would be the third time a drone has struck in the area this month. Two previous attacks in June killed top Haqqani network commanders and Central Asian militants.
